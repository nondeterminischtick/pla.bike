The weather was pleasant for the criterium racers, not as hot as it has been the last 10 days. I watched the category 5 and 4 races.

After watching the races I felt like riding in circles so I cycled 3 Nextburg loops. Nextburg is what I'm calling Nexton Parkway to Jedburg Rd. The road names between Nexton Parkway and Jedburg Rd are Drop Off Dr and Red Bay Rd. This was my first proper ride on the All-City Big Block since installing the drop handlebars. Not bad but the single speed shows no mercy. The flats aren't easy and it is tough riding over the interstate highway overpasses.
