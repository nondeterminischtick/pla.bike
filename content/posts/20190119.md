This ride was on my bucket list. Wanted to make a round trip to Georgetown SC from Summerville SC. Knocked it off the list today. My mother's family is from Georgetown and it holds a special place in my heart and brain. I have many wonderful childhood memories in Georgetown. Now I've added one more.

Great average temperature of 54â„‰. It was mostly cloudy. Good to see the sun every now and again. The head winds tried to break me on the way home but I kept pedaling. I love riding my bike.
