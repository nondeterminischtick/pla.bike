Picked up [Old Yeller](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gq21ooxYrinW7DnUCrYJh2AeoXh0AHcNUQSHKRGj1mQVo0C1whNOL2caKv38oRV22BYSniZAeL8I6BS32Ek4kNVkNplmqYphK2qu1tUjzQ_l-EYiNyK7TmMUirqT32e6SJpVs3QIFNM=w2400) from Mike's Bikes yesterday. It has a new rear derailleur, chain, rear tire, and cassette.  The ride to work was super smooth. Really glad to have the Giant Anyroad 1 back. It is so much nicer than my backup bike, Giant Defy 3. I can't recall an average MPH of 20 so I think this was a personal best. There is something motivational about a new drivetrain.
