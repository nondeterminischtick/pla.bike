Didn't feel like riding this week after my [200 mile ride Sunday](/posts/20200621/). Started getting the itch to ride last night. Woke up at 3 AM to avoid the heat of the day.

Hoped to see a spectacular sunrise this morning with a Saharan dust plume reaching the coast. Sunrise was nice but not spectacular.

Did see a fox this morning leaving Nexton and a deer a few minutes after the sunrise. Cool.

Felt fresh after a 5 day break. Had a mostly favorable wind. Completing a century shortly after 10 AM feels good.

Realized a modification I can make to this route. Instead of turning onto Hwy 17-A at the end of Harristown Rd I should go straight taking Cane Gulley Rd over to Hwy 402. This will eliminate approximately 4 miles on a busy highway. I was taking Hwy 17-A to Old Cherry Hill Rd. This modification should be a winner. If I recall correctly Cane Gulley Rd goes through some wetlands which are always interesting. I will try this next time.

Ride on. â˜®
