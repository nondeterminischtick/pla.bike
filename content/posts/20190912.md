Uneventful commute this week. I gnashed my shin with my pedal at a traffic light. Bled like a fountain. Other than that it was a quiet week. Looking forward to the weekend. Probably knock out a century Saturday.

Sunday I have an appointment to see a cottage at Nexton. The new line of homes are supposed to be smaller than the mansions they normally build. Maybe I'll get out of this apartment one day.

>“The Cottages at Nexton are a chic blend of coastal Lowcountry style and clean, modern lines,” Al McNeill, senior Vice President with Saussy Burbank, explains. “And every square foot is considered. What results is a home that values quality over quantity, feels comfortable and cozy, and allows the home to live large without more than you need.”

>Lower utility costs and a smaller carbon footprint naturally result. So you can feel good about the impact you’re making on the environment, as well as how you’re maximizing your lifestyle.


Ride on. ☮
