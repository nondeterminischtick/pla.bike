For the second weekend in a row it rained and rained some more. It stopped around 3 PM today allowing me to squeeze in a ride. The Garmin says the average temperature was 35.8Â°F. Where does it come up with these temperatures? It was in the low 40's. The wind was blowing mostly favorably.

7,874 miles logged in 2018. I want to hit 8k before the year ends. That shouldn't be a problem as long as the weather cooperates just a little. Winter blows.
