My chain was dry from yesterday's rainy ride. A head wind was kicking my butt. I contemplating abandoning today's ride but I convinced myself to at least buy some oil for the chain. I ran into Publix at Cane Bay for some oil. All they had were quart bottles of automobile oil. I bought one and oiled the chain. Things started to pick up. My chain was quiet, the wind was subsiding, and my energy level was on the rise.

I rode the gravel dike of Lake Moultrie. Always a good time. I was still feeling good so I headed to Bushy Park. Average temperature for the ride was 70.3 °F with a minimum of 64.4 °F.  Glad I stuck with it. Great ride.
