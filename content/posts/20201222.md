Got a call from my LBS last night that my backup bicycle, Giant Defy 3, was repaired. New drivetrain, cables, and bar tape. Put my shoes on and ran to the bike shop behind my apartment. Nice (and expensive) to have a bike shop a block away.

The mechanic mentioned that the spring in the rear derailleur was weak and that the derailleur may need to be replaced. Going to take him up on that. Taking off at a traffic light with a line of cars behind you is not the time for the derailleur to change gears unexpectedly. Yikes. Also going to ask him to remove the spoke nipple rattling around the rear wheel.

Hate to admit but my backup bike seems a little faster than the more comfy Old Yeller.

Looking forward to the 4 day holiday weekend. Unfortunately the weather forecast is a day of rain followed with nights in the 20s℉ and days in the 40s℉. Bah humbug. 

Good commute.

Ride on. ☮
