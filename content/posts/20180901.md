Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:40 AM. From Summerville I road through Moncks Corner, Bonneau, St Stephen, Pineville, Cross, Holly Hill, and Harleyville. It was a little chilly this morning until the sun came up. Not looking forward to summer ending.

I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.

At the end of my ride I road by the Summerville Farmer's Market for some Cookie Chick cookies. Another grand day in the saddle.
