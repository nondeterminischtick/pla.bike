## Ride Summary

* Mile 40 puncture from small wire
* Pulled out the wire with my teeth
* Mile 50 air horned by a couple of bubbas
* Mile 60 chased by dogs
* Mile 70 water cage weld snapped
* Mile 96 car right turned in front of me at 21 mph (no contact)

The ride started out in a damp fog. After I got through Charleston the wind was mostly at my back which was super nice. I've been telling myself to carry 2 spare tubes on century rides but I've yet to do it. Next time for sure! Luckily I only had 1 puncture this time.

This was my 25th century since getting on this kick last May. Looking forward to the next one. Ride on. â˜®
