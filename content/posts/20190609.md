I'm really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I've cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.  

This week I assessed where I am in life. My tag line for years has been ***rock on***. I used to play in a band and the line was appropriate. I've since moved on from playing music. My new tag line is ***Do no harm***. What I mean by that is I will try to make as little impact on our environment as possible and will never eat animal flesh again. It won't make any real difference but I will have a clean conscience when I take my last breath.

Things I've done or doing

* Transitioned to a vegetarian diet. I ate my last turkey sandwich on Thursday June 6, 2019. No more animal flesh. I'm not willing to go full vegan at this point. Dairy is still in my diet, but I'm no longer responsible for killing animals to feed my face. My staples are veggie bowls from Summerville Burrito Company, Moe's Southwest Grill, Chipotle, a Superfood Wich from Which Wich and a veggie wrap from Subway.

* Bought an electric car September 16, 2017. Currently using the grid to charge so the electricity is not from renewable sources. Long term goal is to charge from solar. At least I'm not buying petroleum.

* Riding my bike instead of driving my electric car as much as possible. Bike commute to work twice a week. Bike to lunch and dinner.

* Stopped buying leather products. My new wallet is made from cork.

* Avoid stepping on or riding over any living thing, whether it be a cockroach, worm, caterpillar, snake, frog or any living thing.

* Explore building a small house around 800 square feet that highly energy efficient and  has solar panels with battery storage. This would be huge change from living in an apartment. Not sure this will ever happen. Just dreaming.

Concerning my health I need to work on my diet.

* Don't fear the bonk. In cycling when you run out of fuel it is called bonking. I've been so fearful of bonking that I over eat while on the bike. I need to stop fearing the bonk and embrace it when it happens. Today I cycled for 3 hours 45 minutes and consumed only 3 gels (300 calories) and 72 ounces of water. No bars and no Gatorade. By the final third of the ride I was bonking. I pressed on. I know that I burned more calories than I consumed or had stored. That is a good thing. More rides like this are needed to git rid of the fat around my midsection.

* Stop eating so much. After hard rides I have an appetite than can not be quenched. I need to control this. Not sure how I'm going to accomplish this. Perhaps just willpower or perhaps just eating carrots or something low fat and filling.  

So, that is where my head is at this moment in time.

Do no harm. ☮
