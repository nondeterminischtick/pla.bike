Up at 3 AM and on the road by 4 AM to beat the post-tropical cyclone Nestor rain. Worked out pretty well. Rain started at mile 90. Still riding the back-up bike. Can't find the correct freehub for Old Yeller.

The only downside was the Summerville Farmer's Market was mostly closed. The vegetable stands were open but the main row with the Cookie Chick didn't open due to Nestor. No cookies for me.

Ride on. â˜®

<h4>Mystery freehub on left and what I thought was the correct one FH-4500
