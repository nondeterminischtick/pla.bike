On my. This is a fun bike to ride. The single speed [Wabi Classic](https://wabicycles.com/collections/ssfixed/products/wabi-classic) arrived yesterday. Assembled and test ridden last night. Rode it work work today. I was a little apprehensive that it might be too tough for this old man to ride. Turns out the 46/18 gearing is just about perfect for the flat lowcountry. Speedy yet not spinny. Tough up a hill but not too tough. It might be too tough in a strong headwind. We'll see.

After 40+ miles on it today (commute to work, Subway for lunch, commute home, Which Wich for dinner) I'm thinking this will replace my current back-up bike the Giant Defy 3. Donation may be in the Defy's future.

A very fun commute.

Ride on. â˜®
