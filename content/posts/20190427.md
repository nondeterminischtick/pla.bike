My Saturday was going so well. I started my ride late enough to drop by the Summerville Farmer's Market. Purchased two cookies from the Cookie Chick and stored them in my top tube bag for later. The ride to the [Caw Caw Interpretive Center](https://ccprc.com/53/Caw-Caw-Interpretive-Center) was great. Caw Caw was beautiful with not a cloud in the sky. After walking the park and eating an oatmeal cookie I continued my ride.

The plan was to hit the West Ashley Greenway, over to downtown Charleston and then home. When I got on Main Rd my derailleur hanger snapped. I just got a new drivetrain Thursday. The hanger was bent last weekend in Myrtle Beach. Mike's Bikes straighten the hanger. I should have insisted they replace the hanger. Lesson learned.

Luckily my back-up bike was at Mike's Bikes. A family member transported me from Main Rd to Mike's Bikes on Folly Rd. I transferred my stuff from Old Yeller onto the Defy and headed towards downtown Charleston.

The ride home on the Defy was going well until I got to Midland Park Rd. Me and my bike merged into the bed of a truck. Both the driver and myself were in the wrong.  I should have passed him on the his right and he should not be turning left in that lane. There is a lane [immediately before this lane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/32%C2%B055'14.7%22N+80%C2%B001'49.3%22W/@32.920716,-80.0301924,19.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d32.92076!4d-80.030372) for turning left onto Rivers Av. The lane we were traveling is to go across Rivers Av onto Midland Park Rd. Me and the bike survived to ride the rest of the way home.

The weather was awesome and I had a nice tailwind on the way home. Ride on. ☮
