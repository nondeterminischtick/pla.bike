The local newspaper published a [depressing story](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/hundreds-of-sc-pedestrians-and-bicyclists-are-dying-here-s/article_882982e6-6611-11e9-b638-bb86571a640e.html) on how dangerous our state is for pedestrians and bicyclists. Not that I need a reminder. I question my sanity every day but continue to ride.

Had a nice chat with a neighborhood cyclist who just moved here from New Jersey. He works at Volvo and is a couple of years older than me. He was wondering where all the cyclists were. I told him about a couple of group rides. Also mentioned Lake Moultrie in case he wanted to ride some gravel.

Today's commute was good. Dry warm weather continues. Ride on. â˜®
