Another [bicycle rider was killed Sunday around 10 AM](https://www.live5news.com/2019/09/08/troopers-driver-going-too-fast-fatal-dorchester-county-crash-involving-bicyclist/) on a road I've traveled a few times. 33 year old Megan Walters Rafferty was a counselor at Ashley Ridge High School. RIP Megan.

All good with my commute. I didn't die.

My 10k goal is on track. Cracked 7K this weekend. Currently at 7,065 towards my goal of 10,000 quality cycling miles in 2019.

Ride on. â˜®
