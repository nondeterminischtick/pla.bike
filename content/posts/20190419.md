I knew I was going to get rained on but it was much heavier than anticipated. The rain started at mile 51 and got heavier and heavier. Going over the Waccamaw river bridge in Georgetown the rain felt like needles.

The wind for most of the ride was a favorable cross tail wind. On the westerly section of Saints Delight Rd and coming into Georgetown it was a stiff headwind.

Traffic on Hwy 17 from Georgetown to Myrtle Beach was heavy with plenty of water ponding. Not a ride I want to repeat. I survived it but it was not fun. Ride on. â˜®
