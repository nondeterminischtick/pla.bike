I've been contemplating a ride to Hunting Island, Beaufort, or Savannah GA. I chose today's ride to the Donnelley Wildlife Management Area for more time on Hwy 17. The road surface is not good and traffic is pretty heavy until you get past Jacksonboro SC. A ride to Beaufort is going to be pretty monotonous but it is doable. We'll see.

[Donnelly WMA](https://www2.dnr.sc.gov/ManagedLands/ManagedLand/ManagedLand/58) is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.

The highlight was the sunrise over the Edisto river. Runner up was spotting a fox and a deer (not together). 

Ride on. â˜®
