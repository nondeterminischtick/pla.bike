Four straight days of 100‚Ñâ. Thankfully there was some cloud cover on my way home. The Garmin recorded a high of 99‚Ñâ.

While on Hwy 17-A nearing Summerville I had someone sitting on their horn. I assume their anger was directed towards me. It was kinda of comical when I passed the car while it was waiting on traffic. They blew their horn the second time behind me. I really don't see what the big deal is. We all are going to sit or stand at the next red light. ü§∑üèª‚Äç

Good commute. Ride on. ‚òÆ
