Streak of 10 weeks with at least one century ride comes to an end. Took a few days off to heal my left knee. I think I tweaked it when I hit a pot hole a [week ago](/posts/20200705/). Guessing that was the reason for the pain. My position on the bike hasn't changed since my [bike fit November 2018](/posts/20181113/). Knee feels okay today. Fingers crossed.

This morning started out foggy but the fog evaporated quickly as the sun rose. You know it is humid when you can't swipe unlock your phone. Not a dry spot on my clothes to wipe the phone off. My solution was ride and hold the phone in the wind until it was dry enough to unlock. If you ever pass me on the road and I'm futzing with my phone this is probably why.

Really miss riding through Charleston. Staying clear of populated areas until Covid-19 chills. It may be a while. A benefit of today's shorter ride is I didn't have to stop for refills and risk coming in contact with Covid-19. Two bottles of water were enough to keep me hydrated.

Ride on. â˜®
