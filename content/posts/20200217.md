The weather forecast is not looking great this week. Rain every day with a cold snap towards the weekend. Given that forecast I decided to bike to work on a Monday. Luckily I dropped off a pair of work outfits last Friday.

This morning on the dirt section near Black Tom Rd a pigeon and I had a close encounter. We both startled each other equally. I sure wish they would pave that last section so I could hop on Black Tom Rd without getting muddy.

Traffic was lighter than usual due to the Presidents Day holiday.

Good commute.
