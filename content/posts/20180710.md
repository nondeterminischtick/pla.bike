The Garmin 520 recorded 59°F as the low temperature. That is crazy low for July. I almost needed my arm warmers. High temperature on the ride home was 86℉ which was pleasant.

I must admit waking up before 5 AM to beat the traffic is getting old. Still waiting on a road to connect to [Black Tom Rd](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B009'08.8%22N+80%C2%B006'36.2%22W/@33.1524395,-80.1122457,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d33.1524351!4d-80.1100571) that may provide a safer and later ride.
