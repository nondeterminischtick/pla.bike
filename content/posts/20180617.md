Sunday's ride started at 6:15 AM just in time to catch a foggy misty sunrise. I came out the back of Nexton, through Cane Bay, hopped on the newly paved Black Tom Rd, crossed Hwy 17-A onto Gaillard Rd to Old Hwy 52 to Cypress Gardens Rd. In Pimlico at the end of Albert Storm Dr there is a trail leading to the Cooper River. I went mudding and stopped for a photo of the river. I was attacked by horseflies. I've never seen so many. I snapped a couple of photos including a panorama, hopped back on the saddle and bolted out of there. Ouch.

On the way home I stopped by the gate of the Google Berkeley data center just to make sure my data was safe.

Happy Father's Day.
