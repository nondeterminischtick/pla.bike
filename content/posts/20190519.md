Another absolutely gorgeous day in the Lowcountry. Not as hot as yesterday. Rode on the west dike of Lake Moultrie which was fantastic. On the peninsula that I frequent I was surprised by the number of trees down across the path. Several trees have been blown over since my last visit a couple of months ago.

On the way home I wanted to avoid Hwy 176 as much as possible. Rode through the new Volvo campus to hop on Hwy 27 but missed the turn. Clocked a few extra miles. Finally found Hwy 27 and headed home. In retrospect I should have just stayed on Hwy 176 because Hwy 78, what I rode home, is just as dangerous. Oh well. Other than that it was an enjoyable day on the saddle.

Thoughts about century rides. Most of the time they wipe me out. The last 30 miles are laborious. A non-stop feeding frenzy afterwards. Usually don't ride much the next day. With that in mind perhaps it is better to ride to 70 mile rides than one century ride. ðŸ¤”

The Garmin 520 Edge shutdown with about a mile or two to go. I guess my USB connection was poor last night when I charged it overnight.

Ride on. â˜®
