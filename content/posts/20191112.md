Feel pretty wimpy for leaving work at noon to beat the cold rain. Tonight it will dip down into the upper 20's℉. Bah, humbug. It is going to be a challenge to get miles in with this rainy cold weather. I just need to toughen up. This weather is pretty tame compared to other locations.

My right risk is swollen and sore from [Saturday's century ride around Lake Murray](/posts/20191109/). I think because I changed gears so much due to the hills. Hopefully it will heal soon.

Ride on. ☮
