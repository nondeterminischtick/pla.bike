The plan was to wake up early to beat the heat for a century ride. The plan went to sh*t. I didn't check the radar until my ride was well underway. There was a line of thunderstorms coming from the north and west. Determined to stick to my route I ventured on. I met my match. The storm was pretty fierce in Cross SC so I wimped out and came back home. Lightning was sharp, rain was heavy and the wind was kicking.

Maybe I'll ride a century tomorrow. Ride on. â˜®
