Incredibly nice weather for late October. Mid 80sâ„‰. I'll take it.

Chose to ride Cainhoy Rd instead of Hwy 41 at the last moment. Good decision. Hwy 41 is straight as an arrow, busier, and less scenic than Cainhoy Rd.

Rode thorough Dunes West subdivision to avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41. I haven't memorized the route through Dunes West yet. I tend to doubt my turns. Had to look at my phone a couple of times.

All in all it was a good ride.

Ride on. â˜®
