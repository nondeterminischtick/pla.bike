My first did not finish (DNF) commute. A tack was the culprit. Before installing the new tube I felt around the tire twice and did not find anything. Needless to say the new tube punctured after about a mile. Searched for some water to find the hole in the tube. Stepped in ankle deep mud getting to the water. Found the hole in the tube and then was able to find the tack in the tire, patched the new tube. The mini pump wasn't working or so I thought. Decided to spend a CO2 cartridge. The tire quickly inflated and deflated. Felt air coming out the sidewall. Started walking home. I was about 6.5 miles out. Decided to call a friend at work. He came and got me in his work van. Took a shower and drove my Chevy Bolt EV to work. Exciting morning.

After work I inspected the tube. Patched the one hole successfully this morning but there was a second hole in the same area. Decided to put on new tubes and new tires. Had a couple of 650b tubes that I purchased by mistake. Tried using one. Pow! Blew up at 80 PSI. About blew my ear drum out. Ouch! After that I got down to business installing 2 new 750c tubes and 28c [Gatorskin tires](https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle/tires/race-tires/gatorskin).

Exciting morning. â˜®
