Rode to a Thanksgiving feast with the family. 38℉ the first hour of the ride. After the sun kicked in it warmed up nicely.

An hour after the feast I headed back home via different route. Talked with a cycling fisherman at the North Bridge Park for a couple of minute while I took a couple of photos. 

Ride on. ☮
