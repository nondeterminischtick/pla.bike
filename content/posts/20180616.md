Saturday's ride started off around 6:45 AM. Temperature and humidity were comfortable at the start but rose quickly.

I was baffled by the amount of traffic on Hwy 165. It is normally pretty sparse. The opposite lane was streaming with cars. I searched the web when I got home and discovered that there is a [Lacrosse event June 16 & 17, 2018](https://www.bitterlacrosse.com/palmetto-lax-classic-ii) t the Hyde Park Farm & Polo Club. This [promotional video](https://youtu.be/UQciwwXyuAo) makes Lacrosse look pretty exciting. I should add watching a Lacrosse match to my to-do list.

Good uneventful ride.
