<a href='https://www.whichwich.com/'>Which Wich</a>, my favorite sandwich shop, reopened today after a couple of months. My plan was to leave work 1 hour early at 4, ride my bike home, shower and be there by 5:30 PM. I rode probably harder than any other commute against a headwind. Got there by 5:25 PM to find the doors locked with a sign "We are closing at 5:30 due to the curfew". Maybe tomorrow.

Unforgettable commute.

Ride on. â˜®
