This ride did not live up to expectations. I was thinking I could get to the Edisto river but it didn't work out. I did see some nice trails and cypress swamps but no water. Nothing like [yesterday's ride](/posts/20190831) which was off the charts.  

I can't believe it is September already. Summer please don't go. 

Ride on. ☮
