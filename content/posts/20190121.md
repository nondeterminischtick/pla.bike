Holiday ride. I missed the Nexton TT segment KOM by 14 seconds. If I'd only pushed a little harder. Oh well.   

Kind of chilly for this southern boy. At least the sun was shining. Not a cloud in the sky. Average temperature of 39Â°F.

Called my local bike shop about my steering. When I turn it has a creak. The bearings are probably rusty, warn and due for replacement. The owner said I'll need to bring the bike in. I was hoping they could order the parts and do a one day turn-around. That doesn't look like it gonna happen. I am going to call back tomorrow and talk with a technician. I also need a new chain. Ride on.
