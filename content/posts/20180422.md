Sunday ride to the lovely Lake Moultrie. So grateful to have this lake within riding distance from my apartment. The dike surface is gravel and dirt. As long as it hasn't rained it is easy to navigate. I must say my Giant Anyroad 1 with 32c tires handles the terrain comfortably. Got up on the dike at the end of [W Dike Rd in Pinopolis SC](https://goo.gl/maps/jovFD1nQVe52) and exited at the [Hatchery Boat Ramp](https://goo.gl/maps/LtrLmNxAtwE2).
