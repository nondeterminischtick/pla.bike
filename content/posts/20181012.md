Thursday tropical storm Michael was passing to the west of us. I contemplated riding to perhaps get a tail wind assisted KOM but I came to my senses. I drove my EV to work yesterday and cycled today.

55.4 Â°F was the low temperature during my AM commute. I don't like what is coming. I don't like it at all. I rather sweat than freeze any day. It won't be long before the Gore jacket and gloves are needed. Bummer.
