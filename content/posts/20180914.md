My employer closed the offices today. Didn't take long for cabin fever to infect me. Went for a ride keeping close to home in case Florence sped up. When you are one with the wind it is an exhilarating feeling. When the wind is in your face it isn't much fun.

I started out on Old Yeller but her crank is creaking really bad. Must have a shard or damaged bearings. After a couple of miles I turned back and moved everything over to my back-up bike. The Giant Defy 3 is not as comfy as the Giant Anyroad 1. The Defy acquired a click in her crank during the last half of today's ride. I'll be heading back to Mike's Bikes for repairs. Not sure when they will re-open after Florence blows through.

I am so ready for this storm to get out of here.
