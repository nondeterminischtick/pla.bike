I woke up at 4 AM and was on the road by 5 AM. The rain started at mile 25 and didn't let up much until I returned to Summerville. But hey at least I didn't have to worry about the heat. It was a cool ride in many ways. I love the scenery. Traffic was light for the most part. On the way home when the rain was really coming down a kind human in a pickup truck with a bicycle in the back asked if I wanted a lift. I declined with a thumbs-up üëç and an OK sign üëå.
