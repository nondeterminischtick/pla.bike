I checked my chain for wear with my [Park Tool Chain Checker CC-3.2](https://www.parktool.com/product/chain-wear-indicator-cc-3-2). It is past .75% wear. Time for a new one.

How many miles do I have on this chain? Seems like a simple question. Unfortunately Garmin doesn't provide a way to export **my data**. I signed-up with  [VeloViewer](https://veloviewer.com) which is a 3rd party analysis website. The annual pro subscription is $13.40 USD. I'm impressed so far. They have some nice tools, charts, and most importantly ability to export all **my activities**.

I only have 1,645 miles on my chain. Sources say 2,000 to 3,000 miles is the expected life span for a 10-speed chain depending on riding style and conditions. Oh well. I'm not going to obsess on maintenance. I degrease and lube my chain 3 to 4 times a month. That is all I'm willing to do. I'll get a new chain soon.
