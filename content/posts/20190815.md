Old Yeller fresh from the LBS is shifting like a Ford Pinto low on transmission fluid. What a way to start the day. The rear derailleur had a mind of its own. Shifting and skipping when it felt like it. Frustrating! My LBS let me down big time. I'm going to see what I can do with it tomorrow after work. The weekend is here it is time to ride. 

Work was frustrating as well. Just one of those days where new fires took priority over what I had planned for the day. Oh well. TGIF.

Ride on. â˜®
