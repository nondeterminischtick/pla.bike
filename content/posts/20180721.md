Had a nice tailwind to Charleston and mostly head and cross winds home. Temperatures were great. The Garmin says the average was 69.9 Â°F. I find that a little hard to believe. It was nice but not that nice. Rode the West Ashley Greenway. I love that segment.

On the way home I stopped by the Summerville Farmer's Market to pick up a couple Cookie Chick cookies. They weren't selling any oatmeal based cookies today. I voiced my love of oatmeal cookies. Hopefully they'll be back next time I visit. I also had a nice conversation with a cyclist that I've previously interacted with on-line. Good times.

In the 4 hours on the road I only had one negative interaction with automobile traffic. A couple of guys in a pickup truck told me to get off the road and shot me the middle finger. I was on the brand new 4 lane Nexton Parkway with very little traffic. The guy start bonking his horn a mile before he got to me. I just shook my head and kept on pedaling.

Strava is having technical difficulties with sync and uploads. So, down below the photo album I've got the Garmin Connect embed instead of the usual Strava embed.
