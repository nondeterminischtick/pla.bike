Woke up around 3 AM and could not go back to sleep. I knew I wanted to ride a century today and my excitement cost me some sleep. Oh well. I was on the road by 5 AM which was a good thing. The summer is coming on strong. The earlier in the day I ride the better. The entire ride was on 4 lane highways. The traffic was light from home to Kingstree. On the return to Moncks Corner the traffic picked up all the way to Summerville. There was a headwind on the way home but it wasn't too bad. All in all a good century ride. I don't think I could have ridden much further.

Monday is Memorial Day in the US. I was in the saddle for over 7 hours. This gave me plenty of time to to remember the people who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. I am so thankful I live in the US and have the freedom to spend my Saturday riding a bicycle. Thank-you!
