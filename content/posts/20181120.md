Moncks Corner put out there Christmas decorations just in time for Thanksgiving. Commute was good. Traffic was a smidgen lighter due to the upcoming holiday. I have a 4 day weekend. Too bad the best weather day is Thanksgiving day. I'll squeeze in some miles between the rain showers. 

New lighter colored carpet was installed in my place of employment. I purchased a [mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001THTUAO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my office where I park my bike in the [bikehand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CW911SM/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
