Loving this weather. Late October and we hit 88℉ according to the bike computer. Thought I was going to get rained on today but lucked out, again. Good commute.

Current gear issues:

* Spoke missing on Giant Defy 3 rear wheel
* Identify and repair tick sound while pedaling Defy 3
* Waiting on freehub to be delivered for Giant Anyroad 1
* Replacement Wahoo Elemnt Bolt bike computer is on the way
* Need to ship defective bike computer to Wahoo tomorrow

Ride on. ☮
