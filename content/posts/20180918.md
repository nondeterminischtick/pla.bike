It was pouring down rain around 4 AM. I went back to sleep and when I awoke at 5 AM the rain had stopped. I checked RadarScope. There were storms to the south and to the north but nothing between Summerville and Moncks Corner so I stuck to my plan. The road was wet but not a drop of rain fell on me. [RadarScope](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basevelocity.radarscope) is awesome. Good ride to work. A couple of hours later my back tire went flat. There was a small sliver of glass in the tire. I replaced the tube during lunch.

Ride home was good. As soon as I walked in the apartment door Mike's Bikes called and said Old Yeller was repaired and ready for pick-up. I quickly showered off and hopped in the EV to Folly Rd. New bottom bracket installed, derailleur cables lubed up and a general tune-up. Shimano did not have my big chainring and it won't be available until November. Not sure what is up with that. I'll be riding the shark's teeth a little longer.
