Rain and more rain. As of this writing this is second wettest May of all time for Charleston SC. Bring on a dry hot June.

I brought my Nvidia Shield to work for a coworker to borrow. I packed it in my Topeak Backloader bicycle bag and it stayed dry. Yay! I was able to cycle to lunch without getting rained. Yay again! The ride home was a soaker but at least the winds were calm and the temperature was a comfortable 69.3 Â°F.
