Rode to work on my backup bike because Old Yeller was in the shop getting cables. All the cables were sticking and this weekend I could take no more. After work I picked up Old Yeller from Mike's Bikes on Folly Rd.

Commute was good. The ride home was a smoking hot 95°F. Looking forward to the Thursday commute on Old Yeller. It shouldn't be as hot and there is also a higher chance of rain.

Ride on. ☮
