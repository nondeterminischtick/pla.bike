Started my morning ride off with cookies from the Cookie Chick at the Summerville Farmers Market. Cookie Chick bakes the best cookies. I ate an oatmeal rum cookie and saved a toasted almond cookie for after lunch. Good stuff. My main bike is still at the LBS so I rode the backup bike. Fortunate to have a backup bike. My primary bike seems to spend allot of time at the LBS. I saw a [dump truck take down a basketball goal by the net](https://youtu.be/lwjR48oOhYw) and saw bunny rabbit on Ingleside Blvd. Other than that not much was going on. Temperature rose to 90â„‰ by the end of my ride.
