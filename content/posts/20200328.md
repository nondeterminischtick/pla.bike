Several things going on.

A week ago I road a century ride. Not unusual. I've completed 67 centuries so I have a good idea what it feels like. What was unusual was my level of fatigue. The exhaustion started half way through the ride. I wondered what caused it. Was it pollen, the heat, poor fueling, too much elevation for a single speed, or did I have COVID-19.

I didn't feel myself. I started working from home and decided to stay off the bike. By Friday I started feeling normal and by Saturday afternoon I could sit on my butt no longer.

Started out Saturday thinking I should ride a few miles to see how I feel. Felt pretty good. Logged 37 miles on the single speed.

What was wrong with me this past week? I have no idea. Glad to have recovered from whatever it was.
