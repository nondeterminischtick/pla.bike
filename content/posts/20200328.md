Several things going on.

A week ago I road a century ride. Not unusual. I've completed 67 centuries so I have a good idea what it feels like. What was unusual was my level of fatigue. The exhaustion started half way through the ride. I wondered what caused it. Was it pollen, the heat, poor fueling, too much elevation for a single speed, or did I have COVID-19.

I didn't feel myself. I started working from home and decided to stay off the bike for a week. By Friday I started feeling normal and by Saturday afternoon I could sit on my butt no longer.

Started out Saturday thinking I should ride a few miles to see how I feel. Felt pretty good. Logged 37 miles on the single speed.

What was wrong with me this past week? I have no idea. Glad to have recovered from whatever it was.

Other things I'm thinking about.

My right knee is painful at times. My single speed bike may be causing this. So, are my single speed days numbered? Perhaps.

My right wrist is painful at times. I suspect it has something to do with the motion required to shift gears on my Giant Anyroad 1 bike. Perhaps bar-end shifters are the solution.
