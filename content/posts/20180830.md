There was a [fatal automobile accident](http://foxcharleston.com/fatal-crash-blocks-traffic-on-highway-17a/) at the Black Tom Rd and Hwy 17-A intersection this morning. Rest in â˜®. I reached the scene about 20 minutes afterwards. The police had the intersection taped off. All traffic was diverted. I was able to cycle around the barrier and get to work.

My Topeak backloader bag was not strapped as tight as it should have been and sounded like a frog for most of the AM commute. The PM commute was was sedate compared to the AM commute. All good.
