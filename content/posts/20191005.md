Didn't have a route planned when I hopped on the bike this morning. I knew I wanted a couple of cookies from the Summerville Farmer's Market. Made a loop around Summerville before heading out to Walterboro. Hwy 17-A is not great.Two lanes, plenty of vehicular traffic at 55+ MPH. I survived the trip there and took a different route home. A strong northerly wind made for a slow ride home. Temperatures were in the 70s ℉ so that was pretty sweet.

Ride on. ☮
