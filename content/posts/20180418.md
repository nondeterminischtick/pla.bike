Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a [busy 4 lane highway](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/guEVHE_ZxDhr2Y99epp8Ja3IZWlPJgFvzM9OMnjHTCKxgMKvu_gkt24ZuhqBUoxH6DamVi98tZKY3MYtxSiwSRhaG7W0xbyM08hwxveBPiVlZgLghof35t-74hEU4DkrdnZxw7KLuzg=w2400). The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.

## Pros
* 4 hours of exercise a week
* Green Commute
* Enjoyable
* Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)

## Cons
* Dangerous
* Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)

The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike. I'm not quitting but it is something I think about. I'm looking forward to a longer safer route (5 miles or so) that may be available later this year. If I can avoid getting run over until then I will give the longer route a try.
