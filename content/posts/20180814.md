A pretty strong thunderstorm rolled through the area. After the rain quit the temperatures really dropped. The Garmin 520 recorded a low temperature of 66.2 °F and I believe it. I knew this ride would be short because I have a work thing tonight starting at 10 PM. I tried to keep the effort high. My average cadence was 90 rpm with a maximum cadence of 112 rpm. Good enough for a 57 year old. Good ride. ☮
