Rode a section of dike of both Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie. Discovered dramatically that the Lake Marion dam is closed to the public. Santee Cooper is South Carolina's state-owned electric and water utility that runs the dam. I was stopped by a Santee Cooper employee and told to turn around. I begged and pleaded for him to let me slide fearing that I may not have the fitness to tackle a 150 mile ride. 150 is a guesstimate of how many additional miles a turn-around would have been. After a few minutes of discussion he talked with the Santee Cooper security guard. She agreed to let me pass. She asked for my drivers license, filled out a form, and radio called her supervisor. They agreed to let me off with a warning. The guard mentioned terrorism as a reason the dam is closed to the public. A terrorist isn't going to be deterred by a no trespassing sign. But whatever. Lesson learned. That was my last trip across the Lake Marion dam. Bummed, because it is really a good route.

The rest of the ride was uneventful. The automobile traffic was light and polite. I was concerned about riding a century with the new bike fit. I can do it although it is different. I definitely struggled to finished today's ride more than some other centuries.
