Made the most of the mild temperatures by spending all day on the saddle. Rode to my favorite city Georgetown SC. Georgetown is South Carolina's third oldest city behind Charleston and Beaufort. According to Wikipedia it is also the birthplace of former First Lady Michelle Obama's grandfather, Fraser Robinson. Many of Michelle Obama's Robinson relatives still reside in Georgetown. Very cool in my book.

The shortest route is 130 miles but returning on the same route is boring so I chose the longer route home. This is my longest ride so far. 150 miles. Cyclists say that in every endurance ride you'll find yourself in a dark place. For me that was Hwy 17 heading south into a headwind. Once I turned west heading from Charleston to Summerville I had a tailwind and all was right in my world.

Ride on. ☮
