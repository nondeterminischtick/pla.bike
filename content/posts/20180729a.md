Old Yeller is in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride. The Giant Defy 3 rode pretty well. Not as comfy as the Giant Anyroad 1 but I'm fortunate to have a decent backup.

The temperatures were pleasant. I could see lightning off in the distance for most of the ride but I avoided the rain. 20 minutes after getting home it was pouring. Sweet timing.

A couple of motorists felt compelled to yell at me to ride on the sidewalk. That is always a bummer. I just yell "share the road" and roll on.
