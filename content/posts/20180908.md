Biked to [Bee City Zoo](https://www.beecityzoo.com/) on some roads I had not traveled. The route limited the amount of time spent on busy two lane highways 78 & 61. Campbell Thickett Road was the most interesting. It turns into a clay gravel road. One the roughest roads I've cycled. Plenty of craters and the clay is harder than concrete.

Bee City Zoo has a wide variety of animals. Everything appeared well maintained. There were a good number of employees working the zoo. Good times.
