All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don't have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and that kept temperatures in the 50's ℉.

The route was Hwy 17-A to Moncks Corner and Hwy 52 to Kingstree. Not much scenery except for the Santee and Black rivers. I saw several white egrets gracefully flying and a deer less than a couple of meters from me.  

The last 4 days have been pretty productive cycling wise.
