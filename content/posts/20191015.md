Riding the backup bike while I try to figure out freehub replacement on [Old Yeller](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/anyroad-1-2017). Better figure it out soon because my backup bike is missing a spoke in the rear wheel.

Gave some thought of buying the [Giant Contend AR 1 2020](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/contend-ar-1-2020) as the [geometry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ZYQDZ3-kNvcKlIlBjYZ1yGR8lfuJYoaUHgzlhpyugw/edit?usp=sharing) and components are fairly close to my [Giant Anyroad 1](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/anyroad-1-2017) but that is not the proper thing to do. Keep repairing Old Yeller until the frame snaps in two.

Thought I was going to get rained on today but lucked out. Good commute.

Ride on. â˜®
