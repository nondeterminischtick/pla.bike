Resist no more. Purchased an All-City Big Block from Mike's Bikes located on Coleman Blvd in Mt Pleasant SC.

Been thinking about a fixed gear for some time. I blame it on fixed gear YouTube videos. They make it look like so much fun. This is my first fixed gear. It is like learning to ride all over again. I just keep repeating to myself while riding, no coasting, no coasting, no coasting. My primary goal is to not kill myself. My secondary goal is have lots of fun.
