Remnants of hurricane Zeta provide a nice tailwind to work and soggy headwind on the way home.

Meanwhile I am teed off at my body. My right knee and hip ain't right. From what I gather through YouTube is I may have an IT band issue probably brought on by my two falls on [4 October](/posts/20201004/) and [11 October](/posts/20201011).

Got goals to complete. No time to be taking time off the bike to heal. 3 century rides short of 100 lifetime. 1,262 miles short of 10,000 for 2020. Gonna grind through this injury. ðŸ¤ž
