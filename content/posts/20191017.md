Another week on the backup bike. I received two hex wrenches today. They were supposed to be both 11 mm. One of them was a 10 mm. Glad I ordered two. Removed the freehub and if I get the correct one tomorrow I might be riding Old Yeller Saturday. Rain or shine.

Good commute this week. I had a family gathering after work today so I put a little extra effort in the ride home. Averaged 20 miles per hour with a light head wind. Pretty good for this old man.

Ride on. â˜®
