Wasn't sure I had it in me today. Knew I was at least going to get a couple of cookies from the Cookie Chick at the Summerville Farmer's Market. Made the decision to continue the ride after taking a minute to eat one of the cookies. Glad I pressed on.  

While emptying the trash from my jersey pocket at the farmer's market my leg brushed against a poisonous plant. I guess it was poison oak or ivy. Stung at contact and ever since. Hopefully it won't spread.

Watched a couple catch a huge catfish from Lake Moultrie.

It was a little breezy especially on the dike. The temperatures were pleasant, in the 70s and 80s ℉. It didn't rain until afterwards. Good day on the saddle.

Ride on. ☮
