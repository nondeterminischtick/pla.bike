According to my Garmin it was 26â„‰ this morning and 64â„‰ on the way home. Guess which segment I enjoyed more?

On the way home I was passed, at a high rate of speed, by a couple of dozen police vehicles with sirens blaring. They were mostly Berkeley County Sheriff vehicles. The others were unmarked. I don't know what was going down but I assume it was pretty serious.

Looking forward to the 3 day weekend. I have Monday off for Martin Luther King Jr Day. The weekend forecast is a mixed bag. Warm Saturday, raining Sunday and cold Monday with a forecast high of 45 â„‰. Hope to squeeze in some miles sometime. Ride on. ðŸš²
