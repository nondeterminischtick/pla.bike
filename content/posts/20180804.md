Rode to Kingstree SC for the second time this year. Traffic was light. Temperatures were pleasant. Wind was calm. Riding a century every weekend is becoming a habit. Not sure why.

For my post ride meal I ate eggs, grits, and toast at Waffle House. It was delicious but pretty much anything tastes good after a century ride. I was expecting Waffle House to be a little livelier it being midnight on a Saturday. It was rather quiet. Surprising. Back in my partying days we would end the night at the WH. It was usually a pretty raucous atmosphere.

Milestone alert. Cracked 5,000 miles in 2018 so far. On pace for my goal of 7,250 miles this year. ☺
