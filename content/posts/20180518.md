Today was National Bike to Work Day. I usually bike to work on Tuesday and Thursday but I switched this week to Wednesday and Friday to align with BTWD. We had on and off again rain all day. I managed to escape all but a few drops here and there. Pretty nice rides. Below is a snippet of my ride home. I'm not proud of this part of my ride but I just don't feel like stopping in traffic. I did a little gutter gliding. It looks like I'm riding closer to the cars in the video than it did to me while riding. I always think about how I would feel if I was in a car and had a cyclist passing cars in the gutter. I'm torn as what I should be doing in these situations. Any suggestions are welcome.
