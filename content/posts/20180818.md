Woke up before 3 AM and was on the road by 4:10 AM. Rode down to Charleston and took Highway 61 home. I have taken Highway 61 only one other time, Thanksgiving day 2017. It is not a good road for cycling. It is very scenic but dangerously narrow. Today's trip up Highway 61 was before 7 AM and traffic was light. I counted only 24 automobiles passed me in the lane I was traveling. Not too bad but not something I plan on doing again anytime soon.

My back tire has a slit in it. I was mildely concerned that it may go flat during today's ride but it hung in there. I have a new tire that was delivered yesterday to the leasing office. I will grab and install it once the office is open.
