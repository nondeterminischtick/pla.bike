Long day. Woke up at 4:00 AM and was on the road by 5:00 AM. Left the office around 5:20 PM.

My bike has a clicking squeaky noise. I'm guessing it is from the saddle. Took the saddle off and removed a good bit of dirt. Hopefully that was cause.

Temperatures are on the way up. It was approaching 90 ℉. May 2018 was the wettest month ever in Charleston SC. I'm guessing June is going to be hot and sunny.
