Long day. Woke up at 4:00 AM and was on the road by 5:00 AM. Left the office around 5:20 PM.

My bike has a clicking squeaky noise. I'm guessing it is from the saddle. Took the saddle off and removed a good bit of dirt. Hopefully that was cause.

Temperatures are on the way up. It was approaching 90 â„‰. May 2018 was the wettest month ever in Charleston SC. I'm guessing June is going to be hot and sunny.
