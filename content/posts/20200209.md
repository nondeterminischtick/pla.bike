Another sun filled day in the South Carolina lowcountry. After riding by the road to <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/12R7UmMyoBd82ij29'>Bulow Landing</a> dozens of times I decided to check it out today. The road to the landing is lined on the right with big expensive new houses and marsh land on the left. Really nice but short ride to the landing on Rantowles Creek which is beautiful.

After visiting the landing I rode to Shadowmoss and then to the West Ashley Greenway. Nice chill ride.

Ride on. ☮
