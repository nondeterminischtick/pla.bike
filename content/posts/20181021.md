48.2 °F at the start with a stiff headwind. I thought more than once about turning around in Moncks Corner. I'm glad I didn't. The middle section of the ride was good. Warmed up into the 60's with mostly a tail wind. Rode some gravel, rock, and mud on Tiger Corner Rd in the Francis Marion Forest. The headwinds returned once I got through Charleston. The temperature dropped a little as well. Good day in the saddle.
