Matty Floyd of [Affordabike](https://affordabike.com/) in Charleston performed a [bike fit](/bike_fit_20181113.pdf) on me. First bike fit I've had. It was something I felt I should do at least once so I took the day off to get it done. I can't remember the last time I took a day off. Matty with the help of the GURU Dynamic Fit Unit made some changes to my fit. Raised my seat post, installed a new stem, adjusted by hoods, etc... I'm sitting allot higher on the Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle now. I am going to trust the science. I'll wait until after a couple of long rides before I pass judgment on the new position.  

After the bike fit I dropped off my bike at Mike's Bikes to get the drivetrain replaced. The parts are finally in. Looking forward to getting back on Old Yeller with a buttery smooth drivetrain and a new riding position.
