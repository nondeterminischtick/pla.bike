One year ago today we were getting snowed on. It couldn't be further from that today. Maximum temperature was 70 â„‰. Sweet.

Left the apartment this morning with two left hand gloves. Didn't bother to go back. No gloves necessary. The ride home was sloppy. Rained periodically throughout the day. No rain on the way home though. Ride on!
