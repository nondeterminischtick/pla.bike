Oh my. What a hidden treasure. [Wee Tee WMA](https://www.state.sc.us/forest/weetee.htm) is awesome. You can access it right off of Hwy 17-A north of Santee River. Surprised to see hills surrounding several beautiful lakes. Absolutely beautiful.

My plan was to cut across to St Stephen SC but I ended up back on Hwy 17-A. Not a fan of returning home via the same route so I headed to Andrews SC and caught Hwy 521. Made the route longer than planned but I survived.

The [lovebugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebug) were out in full force today especially between St Stephen and Bonneau where the headwind was strong.

I love riding my bicycle.

Ride on. â˜®
