This is the winning combination for an almost worry-free all-day video recording system.

* GoPro Hero 6 camera
* Anker 13,000mAh battery
* 256GB storage card
* K-Edge Garmin/GoPro combo mounted
* USB-C cable

The 13,000mAh battery eliminates GoPro battery swaps every hour. I put some a strip  of Velcro on the bottom of the Anker battery to eliminate noise and wear against the top tube. It slides between my top tube bag and handlebar stem.

The 256GB card is large enough to hold at least 7 hours of 1920x1080 60 FPS MP4 video. I haven't checked on how much storage is left after a 7 hour day.

The K-Edge Garmin/GoPro mount is rock solid.

Occasionally I have to reseat the USB cable. I haven't nailed down the reason. It might be vibrations and it might be the Anker battery goes to sleep. I keep a GoPro battery inside the camera to keep the date and time current. That may be fooling the Anker battery. This is my second Anker battery. The first one died due to sweat. I don't have a solution for that.

Regardless, this is so much better than replacing GoPro batteries every hour. Replacing the batteries also introduces moisture problems inside the GoPro. This set-up solves that problem too.
