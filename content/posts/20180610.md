On the road at 6 AM Sunday for a ride to Bushy Park. I went through Cane Bay / Del Webb so I could check up on the development near Black Tom Rd. Still no pavement in the last development. Had to ride a mile of dirt to Black Tom Rd. Good to see Black Tom Rd resurfacing progressing nicely. I'd say they are about 70% complete. Now if they could work on Bushy Park Rd that would be ace. That is one rough ride. I spent a good portion of the Bushy Park Rd segment out of the saddle. Thankfully the entire ride was incident free. The new rear skewer and disc brake performed flawlessly.
