Saturday ride to [Charleston Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Charleston)) and over to [West Ashley Greenway](http://westashleygreenway.org). I love the West Ashley Greenway. It is a 8.25 hike and bike trail. Mostly paved with a few gravel sections. Took the longer route home up Highway 165. The route has a triangle shape. The average temperature was 64â„‰ with partly cloudy skies. Pretty much perfect weather for a long weekend ride.
