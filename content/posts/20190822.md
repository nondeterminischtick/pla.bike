My Garmin Edge 520 quit charging so I picked up a [Wahoo Elemnt](https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/gps-bike-computer-elemnt). I really like the device set-up. Settings are all maintained via the Android app.

Funny how a little bit of change throws you off. This morning I forgot my gloves. I turned around about a mile out to get them. I was thinking about what would happen to my palms if I were to come off my bike. Ouch. On the way home I forgot my phone on the window ledge in my office. Again, I turned around after about a mile to pick up my phone.

Good commutes this week.

Ride on. ☮
