Started my Sunday ride around 8 PM. The sun went down around 8:30 along with the temperatures. There was a nice breeze and my legs felt alive. I ate a few bugs. I can use the protein. Traffic was a little hairy on Hwy 52 in Goose Creek but other than that traffic was mostly light being Sunday evening. The moon was at 87% illumination and on the other side of the sky was a lightning show. Pretty awesome summer evening ride.

Milestone alert. 4,005 miles logged for 2018. My goal is 7,250. I'm currently 530 miles ahead of pace.
