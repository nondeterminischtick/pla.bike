Took the usual route in the AM and a different route in the PM. Entered the back of Cane Bay via Black Tom Rd. The difference is a toss up. Hwy 17-A, the usual route, is busy but at least it is 4 lanes. Black Tom Rd is only two lanes with trucks and cars that won't slow down for a cyclist. The Cane Bay route is about 5 miles longer which isn't a big deal but the chance of getting hit by a motor vehicle is about the same on both routes. Not sure what I'll do Thursday.

Ride on. â˜®
