      <title>Too hip for PLA</title>

      <description>After flying over the handlebars performing a crotch skid I decided the fixed gear life was not for me. I installed a White Industries ENO 16 tooth freewheel on my All-City Big Block single speed bicycle and went for a ride. Much more enjoyable with the freewheel than the fixed gear. I can always flip the wheel around to go back to fixed if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling reasonably dangerous.

      <description>Rode the bicycle to work since I dropped off my Chevy Bolt EV yesterday for scheduled maintenance. Left work a little after 3PM and cycled to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet in Charleston to pick up the Bolt. There was a heat advisory and a headwind. The Garmin recorded 100.4 °F as the high and 94.0 °F as the average. Not sure what the humidity was but it was high. I faced a headwind today which I guess is fair since I had a tailwind yesterday.</description>

      <description>Dropped off my Chevy Bolt EV at Rick Hendrick Chevrolet on Savannah Hwy in Charleston for regular scheduled maintenance. Rode my bike home. Nice ride with favorable winds and traffic lights.
I will cycle to work in the morning and probably leave around 3 PM to cycle back to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet. Tomorrow is going to be a scorcher. The ride will be a bit of a challenge.

      <description>Sunday&amp;rsquo;s ride started at 6:15 AM just in time to catch a foggy misty sunrise. I came out the back of Nexton, through Cane Bay, hopped on the newly paved Black Tom Rd, crossed Hwy 17-A onto Gaillard Rd to Old Hwy 52 to Cypress Gardens Rd. In Pimlico at the end of Albert Storm Dr there is a trail leading to the Cooper River. I went mudding and stopped for a photo of the river.</description>

      <description>Saturday&amp;rsquo;s ride started off around 6:45 AM. Temperature and humidity were comfortable at the start but rose quickly.
I was baffled by the amount of traffic on Hwy 165. It is normally pretty sparse. The opposite lane was streaming with cars. I searched the web when I got home and discovered that there is a Lacrosse event June 16 &amp;amp; 17, 2018 t the Hyde Park Farm &amp;amp; Polo Club. This promotional video makes Lacrosse look pretty exciting.</description>

      <description>After the work week was complete I rode my Giant Anyroad 1 up to the Watermark Bar &amp;amp; Grill in Bonneau SC. From work I took Hwy 52, Jessamine Dr, a wrong turn on Powerhouse Rd, Old Black Oak Rd to the Lake Moultrie dike. The dike is a nice gravel ride which my 32c tires handle nicely. The ride to the bar was hot. Drank a couple of Yuenglings with friends, paid my tab and headed back.</description>

      <description>Resist no more. Purchased an All-City Big Block from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes located on Coleman Blvd in Mt Pleasant SC.
Been thinking about a fixed gear for some time. I blame it on fixed gear YouTube videos. They make it look like so much fun. This is my first fixed gear. It is like learning to ride all over again. I just keep repeating to myself while riding, no coasting, no coasting, no coasting.</description>

      <description>Gloomy overcast day. No sun but no rain either. Had a bit of a tailwind on the way home giving me a decent moving time of 47:29.

      <description>On the road at 6 AM Sunday for a ride to Bushy Park. I went through Cane Bay / Del Webb so I could check up on the development near Black Tom Rd. Still no pavement in the last development. Had to ride a mile of dirt to Black Tom Rd. Good to see Black Tom Rd resurfacing progressing nicely. I&amp;rsquo;d say they are about 70% complete. Now if they could work on Bushy Park Rd that would be ace.</description>

      <description>Saturday&amp;rsquo;s ride started off good enough at 6 AM. Roads were wet but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining until I got on Meeting St in North Charleston. It rained pretty heavy for a mile or two then eased up. 22 miles in my rear wheel unseated while I was going over the railroad tracks on Meeting St near Magnolia Cemetery. The bump also knocked my seat out of place. Luckily I stayed upright.</description>

      <description>Good ride into work in under 50 minutes moving time. Always pleased with sub 50 minute rides. The ride home had a rain delay. Planned to leave work at 4 PM but a shower popped up and rained pretty hard. Worked for another hour. The road was steaming for the first few miles and all dry the rest of the way home. After showering I cycled over to Taco Bell for some black bean burritos.</description>

      <description>Grabbed a Peanut Butter Toffee Chip cookie and a Cranberry White Oatmeal Chocolate cookie from the Cookie Chick stand at the Summerville Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market. Ate one on the spot and saved the other for after lunch. On the way to the river I got stung on my left ankle by what I assume was a bee. No big deal. After stopping for a photo at the river I headed down Ladson Rd, College Park Rd and Hwy 17-A back home.</description>

      <description>Long day. Woke up at 4:00 AM and was on the road by 5:00 AM. Left the office around 5:20 PM.
My bike has a clicking squeaky noise. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it is from the saddle. Took the saddle off and removed a good bit of dirt. Hopefully that was cause.
Temperatures are on the way up. It was approaching 90 ℉. May 2018 was the wettest month ever in Charleston SC.</description>

      <description>Rain and more rain. As of this writing this is second wettest May of all time for Charleston SC. Bring on a dry hot June.
I brought my Nvidia Shield to work for a coworker to borrow. I packed it in my Topeak Backloader bicycle bag and it stayed dry. Yay! I was able to cycle to lunch without getting rained. Yay again! The ride home was a soaker but at least the winds were calm and the temperature was a comfortable 69.</description>

      <description>Cycling too fast for conditions. I went for a ride to Ravenel SC on Memorial Day 2018. The ride didn&amp;rsquo;t start out too great. The roads were wet as we were getting rain bands from subtropical storm Alberto. Turning off of Jedburg Rd we took a slide. I had just put on new bar tape the day before. The tape only lasted about 9 miles. LOLZ. The bike is fine. I was fine and continued on with the ride without further incident.</description>

      <description>Woke up around 3 AM and could not go back to sleep. I knew I wanted to ride a century today and my excitement cost me some sleep. Oh well. I was on the road by 5 AM which was a good thing. The summer is coming on strong. The earlier in the day I ride the better. The entire ride was on 4 lane highways. The traffic was light from home to Kinstree.</description>

      <description>Tried a new route on the morning commute. I got off of Hwy 17-A at Gaillard Rd over to Old Hwy 52. Nice change of scenery. It was not quite a mile longer.
The afternoon commute got off to a slow start. Before I could work up a sweat I was stopped by not one but two trains. The first freight train was long and slow. Towards the end with just a dozen cars left to pass the crossing a second freight train coming from the opposite direction appeared.</description>

      <description>It was raining this morning with a forecast of showers all day so I drove the Chevrolet Bolt EV down to Savannah GA. I parked the car at a convenience store and plugged in to their charger. I hopped on my bike to explore Savannah. Riding around the city was pretty nice but it got old after a while having to stop every block. I left the city and headed down to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge.</description>

      <description>Today was National Bike to Work Day. I usually bike to work on Tuesday and Thursday but I switched this week to Wednesday and Friday to align with BTWD. We had on and off again rain all day. I managed to escape all but a few drops here and there. Pretty nice rides. Below is a snippet of my ride home. I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of this part of my ride but I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel like stopping in traffic.</description>

      <description>Picked up Old Yeller from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes yesterday. It has a new rear derailleur, chain, rear tire, and cassette. The ride to work was super smooth. Really glad to have the Giant Anyroad 1 back. It is so much nicer than my backup bike, Giant Defy 3. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall an average MPH of 20 so I think this was a personal best. There is something motivational about a new drivetrain.</description>

      <description>Cycled through Cane Bay on my way to Bushy Park. Had to walk for a couple of hundred yards over a sandy road in the neighborhood under construction. Looking forward to when there is a paved road to either Black Tom Rd or 17-A. The rest of the ride was pleasant. Not as hot as yesterday and traffic was light.

      <description>Started my morning ride off with cookies from the Cookie Chick at the Summerville Farmers Market. Cookie Chick bakes the best cookies. I ate an oatmeal rum cookie and saved a toasted almond cookie for after lunch. Good stuff. My main bike is still at the LBS so I rode the backup bike. Fortunate to have a backup bike. My primary bike seems to spend allot of time at the LBS.</description>

      <description>Thursday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I rode to Chipotle for dinner and afterwards rode up Hwy 78. I was going to take N Maple St to the Nexton Parkway but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find N Maple St. Looked at Google Maps when I got home and realized I should have traveled a few more blocks. I headed back up 17-A and took Holiday Dr to Nexton Parkway instead. Even though I had been on Nexton Parkway many times this was the first time with automobile traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I snapped a photo of The Corner Cafe Bakery in Moncks Corner SC. It recently closed. A Starbucks recently opened and I assume that might have played into The Corner&amp;rsquo;s decision to close. I had a rare tailwind on the way home which enabled me to break my 50 minute barrier again. Nice!

      <description>A microfiber cloth flew out of my top tube bag right into my rear derailleur causing the hanger to snap. I was pulling my phone out of the bag at the time. I usually have the microfiber cloth stored in a sandwich bag but not today. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t injured. My plan was to use my chain tool to remove a section of the chain so I could ride back home. Unfortunately I have lost the pin for the chain tool.</description>

      <description>The Garmin Connect mobile app for Android has a feature called Insights. You can compare your fitness stats to others. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many users there are and if there was an opt-in option for this. Some folks recommend not comparing yourself to others which is good advice. Just do your own thing and stay moving. Seeing how you stack up to others is kind of interesting and hard to resist.</description>

      <description>Another beautiful day in the lowcountry. Blue sky, low humidity and temperatures topping off in the 80&amp;rsquo;s ℉. I cycled to Folly Beach. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with the way my Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle performed after being serviced yesterday at my LBS. Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes on Coleman Blvd Mt Pleasant replaced my rear bearing balls and cups. The drive train was silky smooth and quiet. Super nice ride.

      <description>Heard noise from my rear hub on my Thursday commute. Took the Giant Anyroad 1 into Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes. They replaced the bearing balls and cups. I had introduced water and dirt into the bearings when I washed my bike with a pressure washer. I thought I was being gentle with the washer. Obviously not gentle enough. Lesson learned. Being an apartment dweller I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a water hose. That is why I was going to the car wash.</description>

      <description>Wheee - just having fun! Gorgeous weather continues. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the way my rear hub was sounding so I dropped off my Giant Anyroad 1 bike at Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes in Mt Pleasant. Asked them to check all the bearings. Hopeful it will be a one day turn around so I can have it for the weekend. If not I&amp;rsquo;ll be riding my Giant Defy 3 and wishing I was on my Anyroad 1.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute had a big temperature swing. According to my Garmin 520 bicycle computer the minimum temperature was 39℉ and the maximum temperature was 82℉. That is a 43℉ swing.

      <description>Rode to the Ashley River. Temperature was about 10 degrees cooler than yesterday and a little more wind. Still had a clear blue sky. Pretty nice.

      <description>Absolutely a gorgeous day for a long ride. Started out in the low 50&amp;rsquo;s ℉ and ended in the mid 70&amp;rsquo;s ℉. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a cloud in the sky and the winds were light. Perfect! I chose to loop around Lake Moultrie.

      <description>My Thursday commute was dry, comfortable, and uneventful. I got up at 5 AM and was on the road by 5:30 AM. I think I will stick with this schedule. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sleep an hour later but it is not worth the increased traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday commute started out wet with mist and a couple of showers. The ride home was dry, unlike my shoes, and partly cloudy. One thing is for sure the traffic is far better at 5:30 AM than at 6:30 AM. The traffic is lighter and a little less frantic. Absolutely worth getting up at 5 AM for.

      <description>Sunday ride to the lovely Lake Moultrie. So grateful to have this lake within riding distance from my apartment. The dike surface is gravel and dirt. As long as it hasn&amp;rsquo;t rained it is easy to navigate. I must say my Giant Anyroad 1 with 32c tires handles the terrain comfortably. Got up on the dike at the end of W Dike Rd in Pinopolis SC and exited at the Hatchery Boat Ramp.</description>

      <description>Saturday ride to Charleston Battery and over to West Ashley Greenway. I love the West Ashley Greenway. It is a 8.25 hike and bike trail. Mostly paved with a few gravel sections. Took the longer route home up Highway 165. The route has a triangle shape. The average temperature was 64℉ with partly cloudy skies. Pretty much perfect weather for a long weekend ride.

      <description>Had a rare tailwind this morning and it helped me achieve my personal best moving time of 46:59. I also had a little help from a slow moving 18 wheeler.

      <description>Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.
Pros  4 hours of exercise a week Green Commute Enjoyable Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)  Cons  Dangerous Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)  The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike.</description>

      <description>Recovering from an FBI event Thursday night. Ate some Golden Flake peanuts that sat in my car seat all afternoon soaking up the sun and transforming into some evil shite. This ride was 3 laps on along the I-26 frontage roads, Drop Off Dr and Red Bay Rd. Windy AF. Weak.
At the start of this ride the Garmin Edge 520 powered off for some unknown reason. That is the second Strava embed below with only 0.</description>

      <description>Meeting some friends after work Friday so instead of a Friday commute I rode Thursday evening. This is my first ride with my Topeak Toploader. I like it. Nice to have my phone, gels, and batteries easily accessible. Much better than reaching around my back to my jersey pockets. The only time my knees touched the bag was when I got sloppy out of the saddle.

      <description>Broke my cheap clear sunglasses before I got out the door. On the ride to work I got honked at once and yelled at once. A passenger in a truck yelled &amp;ldquo;Get on the sidewalk!&amp;rdquo;. Yeah, that ain&amp;rsquo;t happening. 16 miles on a sidewalk would not be fun.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got new pavement on Main St in Moncks Corner SC. So nice. The road was in really bad shape. Love cycling on new tarmac.</description>

      <description>Rode across town to Larry&amp;rsquo;s Giant Subs on Old Trolley Rd Summerville SC. Dropped my cheap sunglasses on the road scratching them pretty good. Slammed a turkey sub. Ran into a childhood friend and his son. Good to catch up with him.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a real fan of eating and immediately riding. It was a short ride of 6 miles so wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad but I prefer the restaurants on my side of town.</description>

      <description>I commute twice a week from Summerville to Moncks Corner SC via Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The video was taken during my trial to stay off highways as much as possible. I came out the back of Nexton, through Cane Bay, through Del Webb, onto Black Tom Rd, and finally back onto Hwy 17-A. This route is about 20 miles vs my normal route of 16 miles.</description>

      <description>Cycled to Santee SC Saturday and spent the night at the Holiday Inn. Took Hwy 6 to Santee SC and Hwy 176 on the way home. Hwy 176 is one of my least favorite roads but it is the shortest route. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too busy on Easter Sunday.

      <description>Cycled to Georgetown SC Saturday and spent the night at the Hampton Inn. Saturday was chilly with a headwind. The sun peaked out a few times. Sunday morning it was raining until about checkout time 11 AM. I got on the road and had a nice tailwind home. Not allot a sun but a good ride.
