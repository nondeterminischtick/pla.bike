      <description>Rode the single speed to Ridgeville. Breezy with very light rain showers here and there. Enjoyable ride except for the Hwy 78 segment.
Met my weekly goal of 200 miles with 28 to spare. Looking forward to the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. Hopefully the weather will be good. ü§û

      <description>Average temperature was 82‚Ñâ with peaks above 90‚Ñâ. My shorts were covered with salt.
Helped a small turtle cross the road. Saw some goats.
Took a wrong turn off of Calamus Pond Rd. Ended back on Hwy 176, the very road I was trying to avoid. Oh well.
Instead of taking Hwy 52 out of St Stephen I continued on Hwy 45 eventually riding Harristown Rd back to Hwy 17-A. Nice change of scenery.</description>

      <description>46‚Ñâ this morning. Pretty chilly for the middle of May. Persistent pesky headwind on the way to work. Favorable wind on the way home.
Starting my commute an hour later seems to be working out OK. Still finishing my breakfast by the time 8 AM rolls around. Waking up at 5:30 AM instead of 4:30 AM makes a big difference.
Good commute.

      <description>Rode the single speed to the end of the Pinoplis peninsula on lake Moultrie. The Santee Cooper guard at the Wampee entrance just bought a Ridley mountain bike. He felt after 20 years he needed a new bike. Congrats on hanging on to a bike for that long and happy trails with your new ride.
The weather was nice. A little warmer than yesterday which was appreciated. The warmer the better.</description>

      <description>Cookie Chick SC is usually at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market but for now she fulfills online orders on Saturdays in North Charleston starting at 11 AM. The minimum order is a dozen. I was about 45 minutes early so I rode into Hanahan to burn some time.
Picked up my assorted dozen, ate one, and put the rest in the Topeak backloader.
Had a nice tailwind into Charleston. Took the James Island connector over to Maybank Highway.</description>

      <description>Trying out a later start. I was getting up around 4:30 AM, getting to work before 6:00 AM, cooling down, eating breakfast and changing clothes. All that was done before others arrived at the office. There are some advantages to starting early like less automobile traffic and privacy when you are the first to arrive at the office. The down side is getting up so dang early and leaving work at 4 PM when there is always someone needing something at the end of the day from me.</description>

      <description>Not much to see in Orangeburg but it was a ride I wanted to complete at least once. There is an 8 mile stretch on Hwy 78 that is pretty stressful traffic wise. I dreaded that segment on the way up and back. Things chill out once you get on Hwy 178. The majority of the ride is on Hwy 178.
After taking a spin around Orangeburg I took a wrong turn and asked Google navigation to get me home.</description>

      <description>Hurried home from work to get this ride in before too late. Worked out well.
A few crazy impatient drivers on Hwy 176, Mudville Rd, and Hwy 17-A but I survived.
High temperature was 73‚Ñâ dropping to 63‚Ñâ at the end of the ride. Good ride.

      <description>The highlight of the ride was the fragrance of gardenia bushes when I turned onto Winter St in Moncks Corner. Really woke up the olfactory system in a wonderful way.
I had plans to ride to Cross but I got hung up at work and started a little late. Cut the ride off at Lake Moultrie. Good ride.

      <description>First time visiting I&amp;rsquo;on Swamp. Scenic ride on a well maintained gravel forestry road. üëç
Crossing the Cooper River I chose the road instead of the multi-use path. There were too many pedestrians and cyclist for the COVID-19 era. I assume it is perfectly legal but probably frowned upon by motorist and police. I survived.
This is the first century ride since March 21, 2020 in which I was exhausted at about mile 50.</description>

      <description>Shooting for four 50+ mile rides this week. One down three to go.
Breeze was mostly favorable. Temperatures were on both sides of 70‚Ñâ. The gnats were out on the dike.

Ended up with 225 this week. Any week over 200 miles is good.

      <description>Thursday&amp;rsquo;s windless ride was so nice. Today the wind was back with a vengeance. The temperatures were on both sides of 80‚Ñâ. That was nice.
Rode the West Ashley Greenway because I wanted to refill my water bottles and it is the only fountain around. Unfortunately there was a lot of pedestrian and bicycle traffic on the greenway. I held my breath as I passed folks. Hope i didn&amp;rsquo;t catch COVID-19.</description>

      <description>For the first time in I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how long there was no wind. So much nicer.
Had a great ride down to Bulow Landing. It is beautiful especially when the tide is high and the sky is blue.
I had plenty of energy. Must be all the food I&amp;rsquo;m eating while working from home.

      <description>Passed Tannenbaum Rd many times on the way to Charleston but never rode down it until today. After a mile or two it dead ends with an auto auction junkyard on one side and a horse on the other. Now I know.
Quite windy today but the temperatures where pleasant in the mid 70&amp;rsquo;s‚Ñâ.
Pretty good week of riding covering 199.5 logged miles.

      <description>16 MPH wind changed my mind about riding a century today. Rode to Bushy Park instead.
Near record temperatures the last couple of days. Not today, around 70‚Ñâ. Not bad but I prefer the 80s.

      <description>What started out to be a pretty chill ride turned intense. A domain controller at work puked. I started getting phone calls about not being able to authenticate. Was about half way through my 32 mile ride. Made a few phone calls trying to figure out what was going on. Our network engineer resolved the issue with the domain controller as I sprinted home against a headwind. All worked out in the end.</description>

      <description>Another beautiful day in the SC lowcountry. Rode along the west dike of Lake Moutlrie on Old Yeller.
Spotted a huge alligator swimming the cove near the Hatchery boat ramp.
There were a few folks sunbathing, walking, fishing, boating, and jet skiing. Hopefully those in boats were all family members.
Was going to ride through Moncks Corner on the way home but the was road closure at the railroad tracks so I turned around and headed home.</description>

      <description>Several things going on.
A week ago I road a century ride. Not unusual. I&amp;rsquo;ve completed 67 centuries so I have a good idea what it feels like. What was unusual was my level of fatigue. The exhaustion started half way through the ride. I wondered what caused it. Was it pollen, the heat, poor fueling, too much elevation for a single speed, or did I have COVID-19.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel myself.</description>

      <description>Great weather. Temperatures were mostly in the 80&amp;rsquo;s ‚Ñâ although the bike computer read 91‚Ñâ at one point.
Had to ride through a controlled burn on Cainhoy Rd. Not a smart thing to be doing during a global pandemic causing respiratory illness.
The Ravenel Bridge and West Ashley Greenway multi-use paths were quite congested. Hopefully sweat and snot rockets were not shared.

      <description>With the time change I was able to squeeze in an afternoon century and get home before dark. Nice!
Rode Old Yeller today instead of the single speed. It feels like the rolling resistance is greater on Old Yeller than the Wabi Classic single speed. I think the last couple of century rides on the single speed were easier than today&amp;rsquo;s. The extra gears are nice for bridges and headwinds but if I enjoy riding the single speed more perhaps I just need to toughen up.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve seen photographs of stations like this one but this is the first one I&amp;rsquo;ve put my hands on. Love it.
It was windy but not as strong as yesterday. I was able to squeeze in a century ride on the Wabi Classic.</description>

      <description>Short ride to the Ashley River. Quite windy which sucks the fun out of any ride especially when you are on a single speed.
There is a new Krispy Kreme doughnut shop on Ladson Rd. It was busy. So much so that there was someone in the parking lot directing traffic. No grease sponge for me. Just stopped for a photo of the sign.
Ride on. ‚òÆ</description>

      <description>Awoke to a 4 AM thunderstorm. Showered up and hit the road after the worst of the rain had passed. Wet and sloppy AM and PM commutes. At least the temperatures were on both sides of 60 ‚Ñâ.
Sure wish they would pave a road connecting Black Tom Rd to Cane Bay. That segment is a mud fest.
Good commute.

      <description>Rode up to Lake Marion and around Lake Moultrie. The single speed is perfect when it is flat and the headwinds are gentle. It is tough when climbing hills and bridges. Headwinds are no fun either. I definitively work harder on the Wabi Classic than I do on the Giant Anyroad 1. The simplicity of the single speed is very appealing. It is also the funnest bike I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden.

      <description>The weather forecast is not looking great this week. Rain every day with a cold snap towards the weekend. Given that forecast I decided to bike to work on a Monday. Luckily I dropped off a pair of work outfits last Friday.
This morning on the dirt section near Black Tom Rd a pigeon and I had a close encounter. We both startled each other equally. I sure wish they would pave that last section so I could hop on Black Tom Rd without getting muddy.</description>

      <description>Another sun filled day in the South Carolina lowcountry. After riding by the road to Bulow Landing dozens of times I decided to check it out today. The road to the landing is lined on the right with big expensive new houses and marsh land on the left. Really nice but short ride to the landing on Rantowles Creek which is beautiful.
After visiting the landing I rode to Shadowmoss and then to the West Ashley Greenway.</description>

      <description>Nice strong tailwind this morning made for an easy AM commute. Rainy headwind on the way home made was a little more adventurous. At least the temperatures were warm, mid to upper 60&amp;rsquo;s‚Ñâ.
Saddled the single speed today. That bike is a blast to ride.

      <description>AM 40&amp;rsquo;s and PM 60&amp;rsquo;s‚Ñâ. Nice. New jersey day too. Yay! The zippers on the old jersey wore out. I dropped it off by a seamstress before Christmas. Haven&amp;rsquo;t heard a thing from her. Checked on it a couple of times already. Crickets.

      <description>Took a spill on a trail. Got a little too cocky on the single speed.
The left brake lever took the brunt of the ground impact. The lever was pushed down as well as the handlebars. The front brake was locked up but I was able to free it. Concerned about the bike and the possibility of having to walk home I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to check for my phone which got thrown from my jacket.</description>

      <description>The Wabi Classic continues to surprise me. The 46/18 gearing is about perfect. Getting over bridges and cutting through a headwind is tough but other than that the Wabi Classic feels really good. I&amp;rsquo;m even contemplating making this my main bike. Didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d ever demote Old Yeller but watch out. The simplicity of the single speed is just so attractive. Fun times.
There was a group of about 6 teenage motorcycle riders on the West Ashley Greenway.</description>

      <description>On my. This is a fun bike to ride. The single speed Wabi Classic arrived yesterday. Assembled and test ridden last night. Rode it work work today. I was a little apprehensive that it might be too tough for this old man to ride. Turns out the 46/18 gearing is just about perfect for the flat lowcountry. Speedy yet not spinny. Tough up a hill but not too tough. It might be too tough in a strong headwind.</description>

      <description>Making the most of this warm weather. Forecast a week from now is for below freezing temperatures.
Installed, poorly, a saddle I had laying around last night (Specialized Elaston). Came loose riding over a rock construction entrance about 8 miles from work. Rode it in like that. Was out of the saddle a good bit. Got it sorted for my lunch ride and commute home.

Wednesday morning I got geared-up and headed out for my 20 mile commute. The first 6 miles I was asking myself why am I doing this? It is fricking 31‚Ñâ and I&amp;rsquo;m not having any fun. I turned around and went home. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bike to work this week at all.</description>

      <description>I lugged my Nikon D5500 DSLR camera and a 35 mm lens on today&amp;rsquo;s ride. I wanted to see how much of a pain it would be to carry and if the photos were significantly better than photos from my Pixel 4.
Carrying it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. The strap would occasionally slide letting the camera off my back and around to my front. Might look into something like what Francis Cade uses.</description>

Commute this morning was 21 miles in the twenties. The lowest temperature was 25‚Ñâ. Chilly for this southern boy.

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would log a century ride today. Ride on the Lake Moultrie dike was taxing. It was windy and the trail was spongy from the recent rains. The best segment was on Hwy 45 where I had a nice tailwind. Without that I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made this a century ride. For the first time since Tuesday the temperature was comfortable, hanging around in the 60&amp;rsquo;s‚Ñâ for a while.</description>

      <description>Rode along the west dike of Lake Moultrie. Clear blue sky was nice.
I got a puncture on the dike. Post ride inspection points towards a thorn through the side of the tire. I had several thorns in my leg warmers so this theory seems plausible. Strangely it was a slow leak.
The repair did not go smoothly. I have all the proper tools. Two spare tubes, two CO2 cartridges, a hand pump, patches and a tire lever.</description>

      <description>If you are riding on the road with automobile traffic I highly recommend a rear view mirror. Being able to see what it is coming up behind you while keeping an eye on what is in front of you is critical.
Below are some rear view mirrors I&amp;rsquo;ve tried. The last one in the list is the one I use.
These are fixed to the handlebar ends. It is hard to site-align with traffic.</description>

      <description>Made the most of the mild temperatures by spending all day on the saddle. Rode to my favorite city Georgetown SC. Georgetown is South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s third oldest city behind Charleston and Beaufort. According to Wikipedia it is also the birthplace of former First Lady Michelle Obama&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, Fraser Robinson. Many of Michelle Obama&amp;rsquo;s Robinson relatives still reside in Georgetown. Very cool in my book.
The shortest route is 130 miles but returning on the same route is boring so I chose the longer route home.</description>

It is going to be a challenge to get miles in with this rainy cold weather. I just need to toughen up. This weather is pretty tame compared to other locations.
My right wrist is swollen and sore from Saturday&amp;rsquo;s century ride around Lake Murray. I think because I changed gears so much due to the hills.</description>

First time cycling this part of the South Carolina. Surprised by the amount of urban sprawl around Lake Murray and the hills on this route. With an average temperature of 46‚Ñâ I never felt comfortable. The cool wind, hills, and heavy traffic prevented me from relaxing.</description>

On the corner of Hwy 165 and County Line Rd there is a farmhouse with a couple of roosters that are always crowing. The property owner was outside and I let him know how I love hearing the roosters when I ride by. I had stopped on the side of the road to eat a fig newton.</description>

Chose to ride Cainhoy Rd instead of Hwy 41 at the last moment. Good decision. Hwy 41 is straight as an arrow, busier, and less scenic than Cainhoy Rd.
Rode thorough Dunes West subdivision to avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41. I haven&amp;rsquo;t memorized the route through Dunes West yet. I tend to doubt my turns. Had to look at my phone a couple of times.</description>

The only downside was the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market was mostly closed. The vegetable stands were open but the main row with the Cookie Chick didn&amp;rsquo;t open due to Nestor. No cookies for me.</description>

      <description>Riding the backup bike while I try to figure out freehub replacement on Old Yeller. Better figure it out soon because my backup bike is missing a spoke in the rear wheel.
Gave some thought of buying the Giant Contend AR 1 2020 as the geometry and components are fairly close to my Giant Anyroad 1 but that is not the proper thing to do. Keep repairing Old Yeller until the frame snaps in two.</description>

Made a loop around Summerville before heading out to Walterboro. Hwy 17-A is not great.Two lanes, plenty of vehicular traffic at 55+ MPH. I survived the trip there and took a different route home.

      <description>Another beautiful Saturday in the SC lowcountry. Had a nice ride to Folly Beach.
End of Q3 already. I&amp;rsquo;ve logged a century ride for the last 14 weekends. Going to try to keep that streak going until the end of 2019. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.

      <description>Looking forward to a paved road from Cane Bay to Black Tom Rd. As of this post it is still a construction zone. Probably the toughest part of this route.
On the PM commute I had a water truck tailing me into a round-a-bout and I took the first out instead of the second. Before I realized what I had done I was half way to a dead end. Ended up in the woods again.</description>

      <description>Took the multi-use path in Cane Bay until it ended. Tried to get back on track by cutting through the woods. Ended up on Hwy 176 in front of the under construction Nexton Parkway. Hopped on the gravel and headed home. Made the PM commute almost 22 miles. Cool.

      <description>The Santee Coastal Reserve is another hidden gem. The cape is absolutely gorgeous. Water fowl galore and plenty of gators too. As I rode out on the cape, sunning gators would scurry into the water. The most stunning site was a large flock of white egrets or herons flying. A look-out tower near the South Santee River provides breathtaking views.
As far as the ride goes it was great. I started from Moncks Corner instead of Summerville.</description>

      <description>The new PM route through Cane Bay is growing on me. Really the only sketchy part is Black Tom Rd. Getting off of Black Tom Rd and into Cane Bay is a little precarious too. The entrance is lined with golf ball size rocks, then sand, and finally a construction machinery crossing. Once I hit the pavement it is good. The automobile traffic picks up the closer I get to Hwy 176.</description>

      <description>Took the usual route in the AM and a different route in the PM. Entered the back of Cane Bay via Black Tom Rd. The difference is a toss up. Hwy 17-A, the usual route, is busy but at least it is 4 lanes. Black Tom Rd is only two lanes with trucks and cars that won&amp;rsquo;t slow down for a cyclist. The Cane Bay route is about 5 miles longer which isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal but the chance of getting hit by a motor vehicle is about the same on both routes.</description>

      <description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I had it in me today. Knew I was at least going to get a couple of cookies from the Cookie Chick at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market. Made the decision to continue the ride after taking a minute to eat one of the cookies. Glad I pressed on.
While emptying the trash from my jersey pocket at the farmer&amp;rsquo;s market my leg brushed against a poisonous plant. I guess it was poison oak or ivy.</description>

      <description>Uneventful commute this week. I gnashed my shin with my pedal at a traffic light. Bled like a fountain. Other than that it was a quiet week. Looking forward to the weekend. Probably knock out a century Saturday.
Sunday I have an appointment to see a cottage at Nexton. The new line of homes are supposed to be smaller than the mansions they normally build. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get out of this apartment one day.</description>

      <description>Another bicycle rider was killed Sunday around 10 AM on a road I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled a few times. 33 year old Megan Walters Rafferty was a counselor at Ashley Ridge High School. RIP Megan.
All good with my commute. I didn&amp;rsquo;t die.
My 10k goal is on track. Cracked 7K this weekend. Currently at 7,065 towards my goal of 10,000 quality cycling miles in 2019.

      <description>Oh my. What a hidden treasure. Wee Tee WMA is awesome. You can access it right off of Hwy 17-A north of Santee River. Surprised to see hills surrounding several beautiful lakes. Absolutely beautiful.
My plan was to cut across to St Stephen SC but I ended up back on Hwy 17-A. Not a fan of returning home via the same route so I headed to Andrews SC and caught Hwy 521.</description>

      <description>Bit of a breeze blowing. I planned the route so I would have a tailwind on the way home. I thought a couple of time of turning and going home when the wind was blowing in my face. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I stuck with it. Good ride.

I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it is September already. Summer please don&amp;rsquo;t go.

      <description>Wow, what a beautiful ride. I was having a hard time deciding where to ride. Decided to explore Rice Hope Plantation and Bonneau Ferry Wildlife Management Area. Good decision. Rode miles of gravel roads. The scenery was off the chart. Truly gorgeous area. To cap the ride off I rode the Lake Moultrie west dike.
I love riding my bicycle.

Just think of how many problems we could solve if everyone adopted a plant based diet.
Good commute today. Cooler temperatures still hanging around.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating a ride to Hunting Island, Beaufort, or Savannah GA. I chose today&amp;rsquo;s ride to the Donnelley Wildlife Management Area for more time on Hwy 17. The road surface is not good and traffic is pretty heavy until you get past Jacksonboro SC. A ride to Beaufort is going to be pretty monotonous but it is doable. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.
Donnelly WMA is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.</description>

      <description>Nice commute. The ride home was cooler for an August afternoon. We had a few rain showers around noon which helped keep temperature below normal.
I am determined more than ever to meet my 10,000 mile goal for 2019. Chipping away at my pace deficit. I am at 6,253 which is 102 miles behind pace. Hoping that the Labor day holiday will get me ahead of pace. Onwards and upwards!</description>

      <description>Note to self. Don&amp;rsquo;t ride the Lake Moultrie dike the day after it rains. The dike wasn&amp;rsquo;t muddy but was like glue. When it wasn&amp;rsquo;t soggy it was super rough with new gravel that is more golf ball size rock than gravel. Don&amp;rsquo;t know where Santee Cooper gets their gravel but this latest batch is not bicycle friendly. Oh well, the scenery and temperatures were nice.
Easy Sunday morning.

      <description>Drizzle right from the start of the ride. Actually thought I would have had more rain than I did. The steadiest downpour was around Remount and Rivers in North Charleston. Kinda refreshing.
The highlight of the ride was a huge owl flyby in the Dunes West subdivision. Magnificent animal.
Ride was pleasant. Finished up the ride with a stop at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market to buy the last two Cookie Chick oatmeal cookies.</description>

Commute was good. The ride home was a smoking hot 95¬∞F. Looking forward to the Thursday commute on Old Yeller. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as hot and there is also a higher chance of rain.</description>

Had to take Old Yeller back to Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes. I need new cables. All cables but the front disc brake cable are sticking badly. The LBS mechanic mentioned last time I had it in that the cables were sticking but he got them working.</description>

Hopped over to the Isle of Palms and then up the connector to Rifle Range Rd. To avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41 I rode through Dunes West subdivision on Park W Blvd. The route is a little longer but worth avoiding the traffic.
Had a puncture in Moncks Corner SC. Slapped a new tube on, inflated with a CO2 cartridge and was rolling again in no time.</description>

      <description>The Keen sandals were good on the commutes this week so I tried them on a century ride. The sandals worked out well. Instead of my feet being in sweat soaked hot Adidas shoes they were airing out in the wind. üëçüëç
I incorrectly thought it was going to be raining all day. There was rain off the coast and I assumed it would be heading inland so I changed my route.</description>

      <description>Glad to have Old Yeller back for my commutes this week.
Bought a pair of KEEN sandals. My Adidas shoes would be soaked with sweat and caked hard with salt. First commute in sandals was good. Nice and cool.

      <description>Old Yeller is getting a new drivetrain. Riding the Defy 3 until I get back my main bike which hopefully will happen before the weekend.

      <description>Goose bumps were had while riding on the beach. First time beauty has had that affect on me.
This. was. an. absolutely. perfect. ride.
Riding over the James Island connector bridge there was a Waning Gibbous moon opposite the rising sun.
Temperatures were warm but not hot, blue sky, light winds, no altercations with automobiles, and I felt great, unlike last Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it can get any better than this but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep trying.</description>

      <description>First day back on the bike since my 120 mile ride Saturday. I needed a couple of days to recover from that tough, tough, century ride.
Hot ride home. Maximum temperature according to Garmin was 95 ¬∞F. Good commute.
Checked my mileage goal. I have 5,239 of my goal of 10,000 miles in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m 158 miles behind pace.

      <description>I love McClellanville. Such a beautiful coastal town. Fantastic homes on the tree lined Pinckney St.
My fortieth century had a brutally tough finish. My legs were cramping and I was running on empty the last two hours of this 8 hour ride. Had to stop to stretch and recover a couple of times. I never had to do that before. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the next 40 less painful century rides. üç∫</description>

Received an email today from Strava and Relive today. Relive can no longer use the Strava API. They reportedly violated several terms of the API. Relive made some software changes recently and made it much easier to create a video with their service. In addition to the tracking data Relive started transferring the title and photos from Strave.</description>

Low traffic, cool weather, and good roads. Great ride.
GoPro is really donking up. Half of my footage is just white video. Time for a new camera.

On Palmetto Blvd a few folks were getting their morning run and walk in and a few were cycling. On the beach folks were walking, collecting shells, and setting up for the day. Edisto Beach is a pretty chill place to be.</description>

      <description>Saw 3 foxes on Stony Landing Rd probably searching for rabbits. Would have loved to see the footage but my GoPro Hero6 is failing more than succeeding lately.
Sloppy start in the AM. It had just finished raining in Summerville. As I got closer to Moncks Corner it was dry as a Arizona bone. Kinda warm on the ride home, 93¬∞F.

A couple of turkeys crossed in front of me on Hard Pinch Rd. I stopped the GoPro after that to mark the event for later retrieval. The file is corrupt.</description>

Partly cloudy skies, moderate temperatures, 4 blue birds, 1 red headed woodpecker, sunflowers, and mostly scenic Low Country was the story for this ride.

      <description>The plan was to wake up early to beat the heat for a century ride. The plan went to sh*t. I didn&amp;rsquo;t check the radar until my ride was well underway. There was a line of thunderstorms coming from the north and west. Determined to stick to my route I ventured on. I met my match. The storm was pretty fierce in Cross SC so I wimped out and came back home.</description>

      <description>Part of Hwy 17-A approximately between Cypress Garden Rd and Black Tom Rd is getting resurfaced. I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice anything wrong with the tarmac at least not in the area they are working on. Closer to Summerville the top of the asphalt is coming up big time. Will be interesting to see if this project goes that far. I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining. Any new tarmac is welcomed.

      <description>What a great day. Rode to Mt Pleasant for a family gathering. Had a nice cross tailwind most of the way. The traffic on Mathis Ferry Rd wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as I anticipated. It is a beautiful tree lined road. The entire route is pretty good considering how busy Mt Pleasant traffic is.
After a couple of black bean burgers it was time to head home. The wind was mostly favorable on the way home too.</description>

      <description>I have seen the Belle Isle Plantation Cemetery sign many times cycling Highway 45. Today I took that turn. This is where Francis Marion and his wife are buried. Also known as The Swamp Fox he was a military officer who served in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). Towards the end of this ride I was in the Francis Marion forest.
It may surprise some but this part of South Carolina has some pretty good roads for riding.</description>

      <description>On the commute home there was a thunderstorm off in the distance. I heard some thunder, felt a few raindrops, and battled the wind.
Good commute. Ride on. ‚òÆ

      <description>Four straight days of 100‚Ñâ. Thankfully there was some cloud cover on my way home. The Garmin recorded a high of 99‚Ñâ.
While on Hwy 17-A nearing Summerville I had someone sitting on their horn. I assume their anger was directed towards me. It was kinda of comical when I passed the car while it was waiting on traffic. They blew their horn the second time behind me. I really don&amp;rsquo;t see what the big deal is.</description>

      <description>Super nice route. First time traveling the length of Sawmill Rd. It had the poorest tarmac but the ride is chill. I saw a nice snake catching some rays. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans roads are super sweet recently paved roads. What else can I say about this route. It is a good one and one I will repeat.
Today is Memorial Day in the US, a federal holiday for remembering and honoring people who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces.</description>

      <description>With triple digit temperatures in the forecast I got an early start. I was on the road by 4:20 AM. I finished the ride a little after 11 AM. It was 91‚Ñâ already.
It was a pleasant ride. My favorite segments were Hwy 402 and the West Ashley Greenway. On the way home I stopped by the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market for 2 Cookie Chick oatmeal raisin cookies. Ride on. ‚òÆ</description>

Good commute today. On Stony Landing Rd this morning a rabbit was being squirrely and almost ended up in my spokes. It changed directions and disaster was averted.
Ride on. ‚òÆ

      <description>Another absolutely gorgeous day in the Lowcountry. Not as hot as yesterday. Rode on the west dike of Lake Moultrie which was fantastic. On the peninsula that I frequent I was surprised by the number of trees down across the path. Several trees have been blown over since my last visit a couple of months ago.
On the way home I wanted to avoid Hwy 176 as much as possible. Rode through the new Volvo campus to hop on Hwy 27 but missed the turn.</description>

      <description>This century ride was less strenuous than last week&amp;rsquo;s century ride. Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. Was it my diet this week, my hydration, my fuel, my pace, the wind, the temperature or the phase of the moon. I wish I knew so I could replicate it.
The route to Eutawville was super nice except for the 10 miles on Hwy 176. I started at 5 AM to get off of Hwy 176 as early as possible.</description>

      <description>Morning routine is wake-up 4:30 AM, check radar, shower, dress, and cycle to work. This morning I pretended I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the radar. There was a line of rain headed my way. I chose to ride anyway. Just a little bit of rain on sections of the ride. No biggie. I kept thinking about my Good Friday ride to Myrtle Beach in the rain. Nothing will compare to that downpour.</description>

      <description>The local newspaper published a depressing story on how dangerous our state is for pedestrians and bicyclists. Not that I need a reminder. I question my sanity every day but continue to ride.
Had a nice chat with a neighborhood cyclist who just moved here from New Jersey. He works at Volvo and is a couple of years older than me. He was wondering where all the cyclists were. I told him about a couple of group rides.</description>

      <description>So nice to be back on Old Yeller. I always enjoy visiting McClellanville. They were having their shrimp festival. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to partake but did a walk through and then saddled up for a tough ride home.
It is getting pretty warm. My pant legs were covered in salt. I need to start my rides earlier.
Ride on. ‚òÆ

      <description>The commute was good but afterwards was better. I picked up Old Yeller from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes. I got a new Shimano Tiagra derailleur and a cable, for free. It was free because the derailleur hanger snapped Saturday and destroyed the derailleur. Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes has 30 day warranty on repair work. üëç This is on top of the new cassette and chain from maintenance the week before. I paid for that work.</description>

      <description>My Saturday was going so well. I started my ride late enough to drop by the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market. Purchased two cookies from the Cookie Chick and stored them in my top tube bag for later. The ride to the Caw Caw Interpretive Center was great. Caw Caw was beautiful with not a cloud in the sky. After walking the park and eating an oatmeal cookie I continued my ride.</description>

Looking forward to hopping back on Old Yeller and its new drivetrain.
Oh yeah. Good commute today. More great weather.

      <description>After a nice Saturday in Myrtle Beach it was time for the ride home. Was on the road at 5:04 AM but quickly turned back to get my phone. After that false start the ride was so much nicer than Friday&amp;rsquo;s ride. Very light traffic, no rain, and comfortable temperatures made for a chill ride. It turned overcast around 8:30 but the clouds broke up about 1.5 hours later. There was a persistent light headwind all the way home but hey I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining.</description>

      <description>I knew I was going to get rained on but it was much heavier than anticipated. The rain started at mile 51 and got heavier and heavier. Going over the Waccamaw river bridge in Georgetown the rain felt like needles.
The wind for most of the ride was a favorable cross tailwind. On the easterly section of Saints Delight Rd and coming into Georgetown it was a stiff headwind.
Traffic on Hwy 17 from Georgetown to Myrtle Beach was heavy with plenty of water ponding.</description>

      <description>It is starting to heat up. Need to acclimate to the rising temperatures and humidity. Will need to start my rides earlier to beat the heat of the day.
This was my 30th century ride since starting them in May of last year. This one was as tough as any. Somehow I had a headwind most of the ride even though the route was a loop. How is that possible? Perfect timing I guess.</description>

      <description>A heavy fog rolled in this morning about the time I was leaving for a family gathering in the Shadowmoss subdivision. Rode through some rain showers on the way home.
I saved a 6 foot step ladder. On Hwy 165 two trucks blew past me. One was loaded with construction materials and ladders. Both trucks were probably going about 60 mph but the second one felt the need to go even faster so he gunned it to pass the first truck.</description>

      <description>I was thinking in the shower about bicycle commuting. It takes some effort.
 Get up 2 hours early to avoid morning traffic Take 2 showers instead of 1 Bicycle 32 miles (this is the good part) Risk life cycling with automobiles Battle the elements: wind, rain, heat, and cold  This morning was in the 30&amp;rsquo;s‚Ñâ.

      <description>Spring has sprung. It was chilly this morning but when the 9 o&amp;rsquo;clock hour arrived the temperature rose to the sweet spot.
Loving the new surface on Hwy 402. Cainhoy Rd is pretty scenic for the first half. Clements Ferry Rd, Hwy 41, and Hwy 17 are no fun. Daniel Island is OK if you like big huge fancy houses. I enjoyed the water scenes. A good day. Ride on. ‚òÆ</description>

      <description>This is the winning combination for an almost worry-free all-day video recording system.
 GoPro Hero 6 camera Anker 13,000mAh battery 256GB storage card K-Edge Garmin/GoPro combo mounted USB-C cable  The 13,000mAh battery eliminates GoPro battery swaps every hour. I put some a strip of Velcro on the bottom of the Anker battery to eliminate noise and wear against the top tube. It slides between my top tube bag and handlebar stem.</description>

      <description>Misty morning and clear afternoon. Pretty good commute if I forget about bubba babbling about getting off the road or end up in pieces. Jeez. 98% of automobile drivers behave properly. About once a day some dude, usually in a truck, has to tell me to get off the road. This time the passenger opened his door on Hwy 17-A and yelled. Stay classy bubba. Oh well. Ride on. ‚òÆ</description>

      <description>Cool, strong, headwind this morning had me contemplating why I ride my bike to work when I have a perfectly good electric vehicle. The tail/crosswind on the way home made me forget all about the struggle I had 11 hours earlier.
Had blast on the ride home. Spliced the slightly interesting video clips together with Kdenlive. Good commute. Ride on. ‚òÆ

      <description>Beautiful weather today made for an enjoyable commute. Except for bubba yelling at me to get off the f&amp;rsquo;ing road at Black Tom Rd &amp;amp; Hwy 17-A intersection it was a chill ride home.
My Anker 10,000mAh battery only lasted about 5 months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to charge it for 3 days without luck. The way I mount it on my bike it catches sweat so the connectors are corroded. Probably will buy another and flip it upside down this time.</description>

Had a scare entering Black Tom Rd off the rocks. My bike was not changing gears properly. Turned out the chain came off derailleur jockey wheel.
Except for the pollen the weather is perfect. Good ride on the Lake Moultrie West Dike. Ride on. ‚òÆ

The Hwy 17-A Avoidance route to Walterboro gets an A+ for light traffic and scenery but a C- for road surface. The asphalt was rippled, dimpled, cracked, and full of pot holes. Can&amp;rsquo;t have everything.
The Walterboro Wildlife Sanctuary was a nice treat. Good trails and boardwalks over cypress swamps.</description>

This is the second commute on my Priority 600 with Pinion gearbox. While I&amp;rsquo;m riding the 600 I keep bemoaning the resistance I feel compared to Old Yeller. The commute takes about 5 minutes longer on the 600. I need to get over the added weight and resistance. Riding to lunch and dinner on the 600 is perfect.</description>

      <description>Took the Priority 600 out for a short slow spin around Summerville. Increased the air pressure on 650b tires from 40 to 60 PSI. Strange that there isn&amp;rsquo;t any inflation recommendation printed on the tire. Didn&amp;rsquo;t make much of an improvement in rolling resistance. Ride is not as comfy so I may revert to 40 PSI.
Also rode it to Which Wich for a belly wedge. Pretty fun bike. Not the fastest or lightest bike but still pretty fun.</description>

      <description>Intrigued at the prospect of fewer drivetrain issues I bought a Priority 600 with a Pinion gearbox. Assembled last night and rode to work today. Initial reaction is it is a smooth ride but slow. The rolling resistance with the big 650b tires is noticeable as well as the resistance of the belt drive. At this point I don&amp;rsquo;t see it replacing Old Yeller. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to get rid of the Defy 3 though.</description>

      <description>Mist and fog had me wet and cold on the first third of the ride. The air dried as the morning progressed even though it looked like it could rain at any moment.
The last time I rode Hwy 402 the road surface was in terrible shape. They have since resurfaced the road. It is smooth asphalt with a nice size shoulder. There are a couple of sections that have already been repaired.</description>

      <description>Old Yeller fell over after Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute. Taking a photo and the wind knocked it over bending the derailleur hanger. Took a 3 hour lunch to Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes on Folly Rd. They had about 50 hangers in stock but none fit mine. The technician used a derailleur hanger alignment gauge to whip it back in to shape. He also replace a jockey wheel. I finished up the day at work and went for an evening ride.</description>

      <description>The low temperature on the PM commute (41‚Ñâ) was cooler than the AM commute (44‚Ñâ). The wind was kicking all day. Headwind on the AM ride and a tailwind on the way home. Difference of 14 minutes. Always happy with a sub 50 minute commute. 1:02:53 vs 49:04 moving time.

      <description>While repairing my two punctures yesterday I realized it was time for new tires. The Specialized Armadillo tires had a few cuts, holes and dry rot. I replaced them with Continental GatorSkin DuraSkin tires. There is nothing wrong with the Specialized Armadillo brand. It was just more convenient and quicker to add the Gatorskins to my Amazon cart instead of going to Specialized&amp;rsquo;s website.
I drove the Bolt EV back to the location of my first puncture yesterday to do some investigating.</description>

      <description>Double puncture. The first at mile 81 the second at mile 82. Both were staples in the rear tire. On the first puncture I replaced the tube. On the second I used a patch. My mini pump was pretty much useless. I was near a pay pump on the first one and got it rideable. On the second I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough air in it to ride so I started walking.</description>

      <description>Happy to be riding Old Yeller again. Much more comfortable than the Defy 3. Speaking of which I picked up the Defy 3 from my LBS yesterday. They installed a new drive train and new tires. It now has 28&amp;rsquo;s instead of 25&amp;rsquo;s so it should be a little more comfortable.
Good commute today. Foggy this morning. Warm and windy on the way home. Ride on.

I cycled to Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes on the Giant Defy 3 just to check on the Anyroad 1. Much to my surprise and delight Old Yeller was on the rack getting some finishes touches. I was smiling ear to ear. As much as I appreciate having a backup bike it is no where near as comfortable and fun to ride as my primary.</description>

My LBS called about Old Yeller. The rear brake caliper is weak. They are going to replace it but not with a stock Giant caliper. Parts are ordered. The tech said they might be in tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;m betting it will be Monday. These extended maintenance events are frustrating.

      <description>Absolutely perfect weather. Highs in the 70&amp;rsquo;s and clear blue sky. What a way to start the Year of the Pig.
I almost ran over a rabbit. One hopped out in front of me on Hwy 17-A. I missed it by inches. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear a thud so I assume and hope it got across the highway safely.
Good commute. Lets do it again tomorrow. Ride on.

      <description>The weather forecast called for rain around 5PM which would have been perfect if I left by 4PM. By lunch time I knew the rain was going to be here sooner than that. I left work a couple hours early to beat the rain. Drizzled most of the way home but no downpour. Stiff headwind accompanied the drizzle. Not one of my best commutes.
Thursday&amp;rsquo;s forecast calls for a low of 28‚Ñâ.</description>

      <description>A mostly clear blue sky made this winter century possible. If it had been overcast I would have cut this ride short. Good day in the saddle.
When you ride 100 miles you can eat what you want. Today I wanted a Veggie Lover Pizza and a beer.

      <description>32‚Ñâ this morning. 48‚Ñâ and mostly sunny on the way home. Good commute.
Called Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes about my creaking steering. They are ordering parts and will call me when they are in to try to minimize my down time. I appreciate that.

      <description>A bit of rain and headwind on the way home but at least it was warm. Good commute.
Schedule is off this week due to Monday&amp;rsquo;s holiday. Tomorrow morning&amp;rsquo;s forecast is rain with wind gusts of 57 mph so I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll drive the Bolt EV. Friday is looking good though. Ride on.

      <description>Holiday ride. I missed the Nexton TT segment KOM by 14 seconds. If I&amp;rsquo;d only pushed a little harder. Oh well.
Kind of chilly for this southern boy. At least the sun was shining. Not a cloud in the sky. Average temperature of 39¬∞F.
Called my local bike shop about my steering. When I turn it has a creak. The bearings are probably rusty, warn and due for replacement. The owner said I&amp;rsquo;ll need to bring the bike in.</description>

      <description>I checked my chain for wear with my Park Tool Chain Checker CC-3.2. It is past .75% wear. Time for a new one.
How many miles do I have on this chain? Seems like a simple question. Unfortunately Garmin doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a way to export my data. I signed-up with VeloViewer which is a 3rd party analysis website. The annual pro subscription is $13.40 USD. I&amp;rsquo;m impressed so far. They have some nice tools, charts, and most importantly ability to export all my activities.</description>

My mother&amp;rsquo;s family is from Georgetown and it holds a special place in my heart and brain. I have many wonderful childhood memories in Georgetown. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve added one more.

      <description>According to my Garmin it was 26‚Ñâ this morning and 64‚Ñâ on the way home. Guess which segment I enjoyed more?
On the way home I was passed, at a high rate of speed, by a couple of dozen police vehicles with sirens blaring. They were mostly Berkeley County Sheriff vehicles. The others were unmarked. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what was going down but I assume it was pretty serious.
Looking forward to the 3 day weekend.</description>

      <description>Another overcast chilly January day. Low of 33¬∞F this morning. The traffic lights were not kind this morning. I was stopped by every one of them heading out of Summerville. It is hard to stay warm when you are waiting on traffic signals.
Winds were calm which was welcomed.

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s century ride was perfect. I even had a little energy left at the end. I&amp;rsquo;m usually spent and struggling by mile 80. I&amp;rsquo;ll attribute feeling good all the way to the end to:
 An abundance of sunshine A lack of headwinds An early start Cool temperatures Nutrition (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything different)  I went to bed last night excited that today was going to be awesome. I was not disappointed.</description>

Left the apartment this morning with two left hand gloves. Didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to go back. No gloves necessary. The ride home was sloppy. Rained periodically throughout the day. No rain on the way home though. Ride on!

      <description>What a way to start off the new year. A century ride to the beach with temperatures in the 70&amp;rsquo;s ¬∞F. Crazy weather and I love it.
The route to Edisto Beach is fairly scenic if you can ignore the roadside litter. There are cypress swamps, marshes, beautiful oak trees, a variety of birds and of course there is the ocean.
Good day on the saddle.

      <description>I thought I was going to take the day off the bike but I got the itch and had to scratch it.
Ride started at 4 PM which put me riding home in the dark. Around the lake it was foggy and misty. I startled several white tailed deer below the dike. They scurried off into the woods. The dike was pretty muddy and slow going in spots. The wind was favorable for the most part.</description>

      <description>All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM.</description>

      <description>I had a flat tire a couple of weeks ago. The replacement tube had a slow leak. I missed something. Put the tube in water to find the leak and position me to the area on the tire to search for the culprit.
Found a tiny wire had penetrated the tire and into the tube.

I replaced the front disk brake pads last week and they are really grippy so I decided to replace the rear brake pads.</description>

Before the ride I had a little maintenance to do. Replaced the front disc brake pads. They were screeching on the ride home yesterday. The new pads are super grippy. Love &amp;lsquo;em. Degreased and lubed the chain. Inflated my 700x32c tires to 80 PSI. I had a flat yesterday and the little hand pump can only do so much.</description>

      <description>It rained before I got on the road and it looked like it was going to be a dreary wet day. Thankfully I was deceived. There was a 3 hour period of weather perfection. The sun was shining and temperatures topped out at 71¬∞F. It was so nice. I removed my sleeves from my jacket and took off my gloves at the beach. When I hit North Charleston the clouds returned along with some wind so I put the sleeves and gloves back on.</description>

      <description>Moncks Corner put out there Christmas decorations just in time for Thanksgiving.
Commute was good. Traffic was a smidgen lighter due to the upcoming holiday. I have a 4 day weekend. Too bad the best weather day is Thanksgiving day. I&amp;rsquo;ll squeeze in some miles between the rain showers.
New lighter colored carpet was installed in my place of employment. I purchased a mat for my office where I park my bike in the bikehand.</description>

      <description>Rode a section of dike on both Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie. Discovered dramatically that the Lake Marion dam is closed to the public. Santee Cooper is South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s state-owned electric and water utility that runs the dam. I was stopped by a Santee Cooper employee and told to turn around. I begged and pleaded for him to let me slide fearing that I may not have the fitness to tackle a 150 mile ride.</description>

      <description>This must be what riding a penny-farthing feels like. My new bike fit has me higher and more upright. Felt like my quadriceps were working harder today. So far, so good.
Windy day. Head wind on the way to work and tail wind on the way home. 16.4 MPH vs 21.3 MPH. Enjoyed the ride home 100 times more than the ride to work. There was rain to our northwest and offshore but not a drop in Moncks Corner or Summerville.</description>

      <description>Matty Floyd of Affordabike in Charleston performed a bike fit on me. First bike fit I&amp;rsquo;ve had. It was something I felt I should do at least once so I took the day off to get it done. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I took a day off.
Matty with the help of the GURU Dynamic Fit Unit made some changes to my fit. Raised my seat post, installed a new stem, adjusted by hoods, etc&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sitting allot higher on the Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle now.</description>

Once you get to Kiawah there are paved bike paths. Their novelty wore thin and I took the road on the way out of Kiawah. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of golf courses and huge houses which is what Kiawah is all about but the ride was nice.</description>

      <description>48.2 ¬∞F at the start with a stiff headwind. I thought more than once about turning around in Moncks Corner. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t. The middle section of the ride was good. Warmed up into the 60&amp;rsquo;s with mostly a tail wind. Rode some gravel, rock, and mud on Tiger Corner Rd in the Francis Marion Forest. The headwinds returned once I got through Charleston. The temperature dropped a little as well.</description>

      <description>A friend suggested I visit the ACE Basin so that is what I did. I had not been there since 2014. To my delight it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed a bit.
Not a cloud in the sky all day long. I donned arm warmers and gloves this morning. It was a good decision. Temperature started at 50.0 ¬∞F and maxed out at 84.2 ¬∞F according to Garmin.

      <description>Thursday tropical storm Michael was passing to the west of us. I contemplated riding to perhaps get a tail wind assisted KOM but I came to my senses. I drove my EV to work yesterday and cycled today.
55.4 ¬∞F was the low temperature during my AM commute. I don&amp;rsquo;t like what is coming. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all. I rather sweat than freeze any day. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long before the Gore jacket and gloves are needed.</description>

Upgraded my Garmin 520 to version 12.80. It wiped out my settings. Most importantly my sensors. I had to set the sensors up again. Software upgrades should not wipe out user settings. First world problems.

      <description>My chain was dry from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s rainy ride. A head wind was kicking my butt. I contemplating abandoning today&amp;rsquo;s ride but I convinced myself to at least buy some oil for the chain. I ran into Publix at Cane Bay for some oil. All they had were quart bottles of automobile oil. I bought one and oiled the chain. Things started to pick up. My chain was quiet, the wind was subsiding, and my energy level was on the rise.</description>

Summer is over and days are shorter. I no longer need to start so early. Old habits die hard. I woke up at 3 AM and was on the road at 4:10 AM. The most scenic sections of my ride, Charleston Battery and West Ashley Greenway, were in the dark.</description>

      <description>Grant Ford wrote Morning Trek for me in return for a small donation towards his writing projects. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my return on investment. It captures some of the joys of cycling.
#Morning Trek A breath of cool air, the smell of pavement entrance and entice the morning senses with freedom from the daily enslavement of cars and trucks and motorized fences. With the strength of will, the body exerts upon the gears of destiny and fate to consume the miles combustion preverts; you breathe the clean air, your spirit to sate.</description>

There were storms to the south and to the north but nothing between Summerville and Moncks Corner so I stuck to my plan. The road was wet but not a drop of rain fell on me. RadarScope is awesome. Good ride to work. A couple of hours later my back tire went flat.</description>

      <description>My employer closed the offices today. Didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for cabin fever to infect me. Went for a ride keeping close to home in case Florence sped up. When you are one with the wind it is an exhilarating feeling. When the wind is in your face it isn&amp;rsquo;t much fun.
I started out on Old Yeller but her crank is creaking really bad. Must have a shard or damaged bearings.</description>

      <description>Biked to Bee City Zoo on some roads I had not traveled. The route limited the amount of time spent on busy two lane highways 78 &amp;amp; 61. Campbell Thickett Road was the most interesting. It turns into a clay gravel road. One the roughest roads I&amp;rsquo;ve cycled. Plenty of craters and the clay is harder than concrete.
Bee City Zoo has a wide variety of animals. Everything appeared well maintained.</description>

      <description>First time riding on the Lake Marion dike and The Santee Dam. Took me a little while to find the gate to the dike. It was still dark when I arrived. I ended up at Wilson&amp;rsquo;s landing which is several miles from where I needed to be. The entrance to the dike is a yellow gate behind a Santee Cooper garage to the right of the Harry&amp;rsquo;s Fish Camp entrance.</description>

      <description>Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:40 AM. From Summerville I rode through Moncks Corner, Bonneau, St Stephen, Pineville, Cross, Holly Hill, and Harleyville. It was a little chilly this morning until the sun came up. Not looking forward to summer ending.
I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.
At the end of my ride I rode by the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market for some Cookie Chick cookies.</description>

      <description>There was a fatal automobile accident at the Black Tom Rd and Hwy 17-A intersection this morning. Rest in ‚òÆ. I reached the scene about 20 minutes afterwards. The police had the intersection taped off. All traffic was diverted. I was able to cycle around the barrier and get to work.
My Topeak backloader bag was not strapped as tight as it should have been and sounded like a frog for most of the AM commute.</description>

      <description>Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:18 AM. Nice tail wind for 70 miles. Tough head wind on the last leg of the ride. Shifting on Old Yeller is a little slow but other than that she is riding like a champ. Good day in the saddle.

      <description>Cycling yields quality spirits. I am happy with the way the photo in front of Watkins Package Store developed. üì∑ It was a split decision to take a photo here. So much so I almost wipe out when I turned off the road into a sand mound. Crisis averted and photo snapped.
Up at 5 AM and pedaling by 5:21 AM. Had a head wind on the way to work and a tail on the way home.</description>

      <description>Made it to work in 46 minutes thanks to a tail wind. The wind didn&amp;rsquo;t shift during the day so I had a stiff head wind on the way home. The wind giveth and taketh away.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t commuted on the bike lately in lieu of evening rides. This commute was a little different in that I carried my clothes to work in my Topeak Backloader bag. Normally I store clothes in my office when I drive the EV.</description>

      <description>Ran into some rain on the last 3rd of Sunday&amp;rsquo;s ride. Cypress Gardens Rd in under repair. There were cones down the center of the road and made it difficult for cars and trucks to pass me. I got off the road at Lazy Hill Rd so the long line of cars could get in front of me.
First two thirds of the ride were pretty chill. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it.</description>

      <description>Woke up before 3 AM and was on the road by 4:10 AM. Rode down to Charleston and took Highway 61 home. I have taken Highway 61 only one other time, Thanksgiving day 2017. It is not a good road for cycling. It is very scenic but dangerously narrow. Today&amp;rsquo;s trip up Highway 61 was before 7 AM and traffic was light. I counted only 24 automobiles passed me in the lane I was traveling.</description>

      <description>A pretty strong thunderstorm rolled through the area. After the rain quit the temperatures really dropped. The Garmin 520 recorded a low temperature of 66.2 ¬∞F and I believe it. I knew this ride would be short because I have a work thing tonight starting at 10 PM. I tried to keep the effort high. My average cadence was 90 rpm with a maximum cadence of 112 rpm. Good enough for a 57 year old.</description>

      <description>Almost bit off more than I could chew. My intention was to knock out an easy 30 mile ride under overcast skies. A few minutes into the ride the clouds cleared and the heat returned. I finished up with 56 miles. After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s century ride I was pretty whipped. The end of today&amp;rsquo;s ride was tough going.

Today&amp;rsquo;s ride started at 4:57 AM. Nice to have the roads all to myself for a while. There was a summer shower in West Ashley but the rest of the ride was dry. Good day.

      <description>Rode to Kingstree SC for the second time this year. Traffic was light. Temperatures were pleasant. Wind was calm. Riding a century every weekend is becoming a habit. Not sure why.
For my post ride meal I ate eggs, grits, and toast at Waffle House. It was delicious but pretty much anything tastes good after a century ride. I was expecting Waffle House to be a little livelier it being midnight on a Saturday.</description>

      <description>Old Yeller is still in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride to the Mt Pleasant Pier. Comfortable temperatures, nice sky, and a tailwind home. Pretty much a perfect summer evening. I was concerned about my lights dying but they hung on to the very end around 11 PM.

      <description>Old Yeller is in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride. The Giant Defy 3 rode pretty well. Not as comfy as the Giant Anyroad 1 but I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to have a decent backup.
The temperatures were pleasant. I could see lightning off in the distance for most of the ride but I avoided the rain. 20 minutes after getting home it was pouring.</description>

      <description>Shifting was less than stellar during yesterday&amp;rsquo;s ride. Checked the chain and it is at .75% wear. Time for a replacement.

I see some wear on the cassette as well. I may get that replaced. I will drop off the Giant Anyroad 1 at Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes today.

The Park Cyclone Chain Scrubber works well but the rivets that hold the clips fall out. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost one rivet. The other one falls out occasionally.</description>

      <description>Mapped out my route Friday night and pretty much stuck to it. This is my third century ride for July 2018. It was a enjoyable ride except for Highway 402. It is the worst road surface I&amp;rsquo;ve ever ridden. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ride that highway again until they pave it which will probably be a very long time from now.
My favorite segments were the West Ashley Greenway, Charleston Battery, and Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.</description>

      <description>Afternoon thunderstorms cleared for a nice evening ride. I dropped by the Ashley River. Good times.
I overestimated the charge in my two rear lights. They both died about 30 minutes prior to the end of my ride. That was a little dicey. I need to make a habit when I get home to immediately remove my lights from my bike and connect them to the charger. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it later&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

I do like to ride through Cane Bay on Sunday to check on the progress near Black Tom Rd. So that is were I headed. They have asphalt almost to Black Tom Rd. Looking good.
I then headed towards Moncks Corner and decided to get on the Lake Moultrie dike. Once I got to Bonneau I wanted to find where I could continue on the dike.</description>

A road cyclist passed me on a section of the Sawmill Branch trail. I fell behind by about 20 seconds and was struggling to keep up with him while he looked like he was out for a casual Sunday spin. Oh well. Where the end of the trail empties onto a rock road, me and my 32c tires kept rolling.</description>

The road names between Nexton Parkway and Jedburg Rd are Drop Off Dr and Red Bay Rd. This was my first proper ride on the All-City Big Block since installing the drop handlebars.</description>

      <description>Replaced the Kalloy 700mm Riser handlebars with Giant Connect XR drop handlebars. These are the same handlebars that are on my Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle. I am using the Tektro RL520 lever set and have Sunlite Road foam grips for simplicity and comfort.</description>

      <description>Started my Sunday ride around 8 PM. The sun went down around 8:30 along with the temperatures. There was a nice breeze and my legs felt alive. I ate a few bugs. I can use the protein. Traffic was a little hairy on Hwy 52 in Goose Creek but other than that traffic was mostly light being Sunday evening. The moon was at 87% illumination and on the other side of the sky was a lightning show.</description>

      <description>My legs were dead this morning. Don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is the heat or the 40 mile ride Thursday night on the single speed. Hopefully tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s ride will be better. Took some different roads on this Charleston trip. Rode by the airport, Park Circle, and came back home on Dorchester Rd.

      <description>After flying over the handlebars performing a crotch skid I decided the fixed gear life was not for me. I installed a White Industries ENO 16 tooth freewheel on my All-City Big Block single speed bicycle and went for a ride. Much more enjoyable with the freewheel than the fixed gear. I can always flip the wheel around to go back to fixed if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling reasonably dangerous.

      <description>Rode the bicycle to work since I dropped off my Chevy Bolt EV yesterday for scheduled maintenance. Left work a little after 3PM and cycled to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet in Charleston to pick up the Bolt. There was a heat advisory and a headwind. The Garmin recorded 100.4 ¬∞F as the high and 94.0 ¬∞F as the average. Not sure what the humidity was but it was high. I faced a headwind today which I guess is fair since I had a tailwind yesterday.</description>

      <description>Dropped off my Chevy Bolt EV at Rick Hendrick Chevrolet on Savannah Hwy in Charleston for regular scheduled maintenance. Rode my bike home. Nice ride with favorable winds and traffic lights.
I will cycle to work in the morning and probably leave around 3 PM to cycle back to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet. Tomorrow is going to be a scorcher. The ride will be a bit of a challenge.

      <description>Sunday&amp;rsquo;s ride started at 6:15 AM just in time to catch a foggy misty sunrise. I came out the back of Nexton, through Cane Bay, hopped on the newly paved Black Tom Rd, crossed Hwy 17-A onto Gaillard Rd to Old Hwy 52 to Cypress Gardens Rd. In Pimlico at the end of Albert Storm Dr there is a trail leading to the Cooper River. I went mudding and stopped for a photo of the river.</description>

      <description>Saturday&amp;rsquo;s ride started off around 6:45 AM. Temperature and humidity were comfortable at the start but rose quickly.
I was baffled by the amount of traffic on Hwy 165. It is normally pretty sparse. The opposite lane was streaming with cars. I searched the web when I got home and discovered that there is a Lacrosse event June 16 &amp;amp; 17, 2018 t the Hyde Park Farm &amp;amp; Polo Club. This promotional video makes Lacrosse look pretty exciting.</description>

      <description>After the work week was complete I rode my Giant Anyroad 1 up to the Watermark Bar &amp;amp; Grill in Bonneau SC. From work I took Hwy 52, Jessamine Dr, a wrong turn on Powerhouse Rd, Old Black Oak Rd to the Lake Moultrie dike. The dike is a nice gravel ride which my 32c tires handle nicely. The ride to the bar was hot. Drank a couple of Yuenglings with friends, paid my tab and headed back.</description>

      <description>Resist no more. Purchased an All-City Big Block from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes located on Coleman Blvd in Mt Pleasant SC.
Been thinking about a fixed gear for some time. I blame it on fixed gear YouTube videos. They make it look like so much fun. This is my first fixed gear. It is like learning to ride all over again. I just keep repeating to myself while riding, no coasting, no coasting, no coasting.</description>

      <description>On the road at 6 AM Sunday for a ride to Bushy Park. I went through Cane Bay / Del Webb so I could check up on the development near Black Tom Rd. Still no pavement in the last development. Had to ride a mile of dirt to Black Tom Rd. Good to see Black Tom Rd resurfacing progressing nicely. I&amp;rsquo;d say they are about 70% complete. Now if they could work on Bushy Park Rd that would be ace.</description>

      <description>Saturday&amp;rsquo;s ride started off good enough at 6 AM. Roads were wet but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining until I got on Meeting St in North Charleston. It rained pretty heavy for a mile or two then eased up. 22 miles in my rear wheel unseated while I was going over the railroad tracks on Meeting St near Magnolia Cemetery. The bump also knocked my seat out of place. Luckily I stayed upright.</description>

      <description>Good ride into work in under 50 minutes moving time. Always pleased with sub 50 minute rides. The ride home had a rain delay. Planned to leave work at 4 PM but a shower popped up and rained pretty hard. Worked for another hour. The road was steaming for the first few miles and all dry the rest of the way home. After showering I cycled over to Taco Bell for some black bean burritos.</description>

      <description>Grabbed a Peanut Butter Toffee Chip cookie and a Cranberry White Oatmeal Chocolate cookie from the Cookie Chick stand at the Summerville Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market. Ate one on the spot and saved the other for after lunch. On the way to the river I got stung on my left ankle by what I assume was a bee. No big deal. After stopping for a photo at the river I headed down Ladson Rd, College Park Rd and Hwy 17-A back home.</description>

      <description>Long day. Woke up at 4:00 AM and was on the road by 5:00 AM. Left the office around 5:20 PM.
My bike has a clicking squeaky noise. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it is from the saddle. Took the saddle off and removed a good bit of dirt. Hopefully that was cause.
Temperatures are on the way up. It was approaching 90 ‚Ñâ. May 2018 was the wettest month ever in Charleston SC.</description>

      <description>Rain and more rain. As of this writing this is second wettest May of all time for Charleston SC. Bring on a dry hot June.
I brought my Nvidia Shield to work for a coworker to borrow. I packed it in my Topeak Backloader bicycle bag and it stayed dry. Yay! I was able to cycle to lunch without getting rained. Yay again! The ride home was a soaker but at least the winds were calm and the temperature was a comfortable 69.</description>

      <description>Cycling too fast for conditions. I went for a ride to Ravenel SC on Memorial Day 2018. The ride didn&amp;rsquo;t start out too great. The roads were wet as we were getting rain bands from subtropical storm Alberto. Turning off of Jedburg Rd we took a slide. I had just put on new bar tape the day before. The tape only lasted about 9 miles. LOLZ. The bike is fine. I was fine and continued on with the ride without further incident.</description>

      <description>Woke up around 3 AM and could not go back to sleep. I knew I wanted to ride a century today and my excitement cost me some sleep. Oh well. I was on the road by 5 AM which was a good thing. The summer is coming on strong. The earlier in the day I ride the better. The entire ride was on 4 lane highways. The traffic was light from home to Kingstree.</description>

      <description>Tried a new route on the morning commute. I got off of Hwy 17-A at Gaillard Rd over to Old Hwy 52. Nice change of scenery. It was not quite a mile longer.
The afternoon commute got off to a slow start. Before I could work up a sweat I was stopped by not one but two trains. The first freight train was long and slow. Towards the end with just a dozen cars left to pass the crossing a second freight train coming from the opposite direction appeared.</description>

      <description>It was raining this morning with a forecast of showers all day so I drove the Chevrolet Bolt EV down to Savannah GA. I parked the car at a convenience store and plugged in to their charger. I hopped on my bike to explore Savannah. Riding around the city was pretty nice but it got old after a while having to stop every block. I left the city and headed down to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge.</description>

We had on and off again rain all day. I managed to escape all but a few drops here and there. Pretty nice rides. Below is a snippet of my ride home.

      <description>Picked up Old Yeller from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes yesterday. It has a new rear derailleur, chain, rear tire, and cassette. The ride to work was super smooth. Really glad to have the Giant Anyroad 1 back. It is so much nicer than my backup bike, Giant Defy 3. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall an average MPH of 20 so I think this was a personal best. There is something motivational about a new drivetrain.</description>

      <description>Cycled through Cane Bay on my way to Bushy Park. Had to walk for a couple of hundred yards over a sandy road in the neighborhood under construction. Looking forward to when there is a paved road to either Black Tom Rd or 17-A. The rest of the ride was pleasant. Not as hot as yesterday and traffic was light.

I ate an oatmeal rum cookie and saved a toasted almond cookie for after lunch. Good stuff. My main bike is still at the LBS so I rode the backup bike. Fortunate to have a backup bike. My primary bike seems to spend allot of time at the LBS.</description>

      <description>Thursday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I rode to Chipotle for dinner and afterwards rode up Hwy 78. I was going to take N Maple St to the Nexton Parkway but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find N Maple St. Looked at Google Maps when I got home and realized I should have traveled a few more blocks. I headed back up 17-A and took Holiday Dr to Nexton Parkway instead. Even though I had been on Nexton Parkway many times this was the first time with automobile traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I snapped a photo of The Corner Cafe Bakery in Moncks Corner SC. It recently closed. A Starbucks recently opened and I assume that might have played into The Corner&amp;rsquo;s decision to close. I had a rare tailwind on the way home which enabled me to break my 50 minute barrier again. Nice!

      <description>A microfiber cloth flew out of my top tube bag right into my rear derailleur causing the hanger to snap. I was pulling my phone out of the bag at the time. I usually have the microfiber cloth stored in a sandwich bag but not today. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t injured. My plan was to use my chain tool to remove a section of the chain so I could ride back home. Unfortunately I have lost the pin for the chain tool.</description>

      <description>The Garmin Connect mobile app for Android has a feature called Insights. You can compare your fitness stats to others. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many users there are and if there was an opt-in option for this. Some folks recommend not comparing yourself to others which is good advice. Just do your own thing and stay moving. Seeing how you stack up to others is kind of interesting and hard to resist.</description>

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with the way my Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle performed after being serviced yesterday at my LBS. Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes on Coleman Blvd Mt Pleasant replaced my rear bearing balls and cups. The drive train was silky smooth and quiet. Super nice ride.

      <description>Heard noise from my rear hub on my Thursday commute. Took the Giant Anyroad 1 into Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes. They replaced the bearing balls and cups. I had introduced water and dirt into the bearings when I washed my bike with a pressure washer. I thought I was being gentle with the washer. Obviously not gentle enough. Lesson learned. Being an apartment dweller I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a water hose. That is why I was going to the car wash.</description>

      <description>Wheee - just having fun! Gorgeous weather continues. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the way my rear hub was sounding so I dropped off my Giant Anyroad 1 bike at Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes in Mt Pleasant. Asked them to check all the bearings. Hopeful it will be a one day turn around so I can have it for the weekend. If not I&amp;rsquo;ll be riding my Giant Defy 3 and wishing I was on my Anyroad 1.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute had a big temperature swing. According to my Garmin 520 bicycle computer the minimum temperature was 39‚Ñâ and the maximum temperature was 82‚Ñâ. That is a 43‚Ñâ swing.

      <description>Rode to the Ashley River. Temperature was about 10 degrees cooler than yesterday and a little more wind. Still had a clear blue sky. Pretty nice.

      <description>Absolutely a gorgeous day for a long ride. Started out in the low 50&amp;rsquo;s ‚Ñâ and ended in the mid 70&amp;rsquo;s ‚Ñâ. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a cloud in the sky and the winds were light. Perfect! I chose to loop around Lake Moultrie.

      <description>My Thursday commute was dry, comfortable, and uneventful. I got up at 5 AM and was on the road by 5:30 AM. I think I will stick with this schedule. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sleep an hour later but it is not worth the increased traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday commute started out wet with mist and a couple of showers. The ride home was dry, unlike my shoes, and partly cloudy. One thing is for sure the traffic is far better at 5:30 AM than at 6:30 AM. The traffic is lighter and a little less frantic. Absolutely worth getting up at 5 AM for.

      <description>Sunday ride to the lovely Lake Moultrie. So grateful to have this lake within riding distance from my apartment. The dike surface is gravel and dirt. As long as it hasn&amp;rsquo;t rained it is easy to navigate. I must say my Giant Anyroad 1 with 32c tires handles the terrain comfortably. Got up on the dike at the end of W Dike Rd in Pinopolis SC and exited at the Hatchery Boat Ramp.</description>

      <description>Saturday ride to Charleston Battery and over to West Ashley Greenway. I love the West Ashley Greenway. It is a 8.25 hike and bike trail. Mostly paved with a few gravel sections. Took the longer route home up Highway 165. The route has a triangle shape. The average temperature was 64‚Ñâ with partly cloudy skies. Pretty much perfect weather for a long weekend ride.

      <description>Had a rare tailwind this morning and it helped me achieve my personal best moving time of 46:59. I also had a little help from a slow moving 18 wheeler.

      <description>Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.
Pros  4 hours of exercise a week Green Commute Enjoyable Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)  Cons  Dangerous Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)  The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike.</description>

      <description>Recovering from an FBI event Thursday night. Ate some Golden Flake peanuts that sat in my car seat all afternoon soaking up the sun and transforming into some evil shite. This ride was 3 laps on along the I-26 frontage roads, Drop Off Dr and Red Bay Rd. Windy AF. Weak.
At the start of this ride the Garmin Edge 520 powered off for some unknown reason. That is the second Strava embed below with only 0.</description>

      <description>Meeting some friends after work Friday so instead of a Friday commute I rode Thursday evening. This is my first ride with my Topeak Toploader. I like it. Nice to have my phone, gels, and batteries easily accessible. Much better than reaching around my back to my jersey pockets. The only time my knees touched the bag was when I got sloppy out of the saddle.

      <description>[Broke my cheap clear sunglasses] (https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nfURpwsIbLAyPhASAA_PphbFkkcZAiCYWSvPTwsd8UpJtDCxqWtQCA_Hzg67TkO6NqSqa23hNofjbzt6CsFJOlnEAn_Phz01SqnyPdEm3b4fE-CjSH7iQTNAj1vsfJTmu_5mTIxTZnM=w2400) before I got out the door. On the ride to work I got honked at once and yelled at once. A passenger in a truck yelled &amp;ldquo;Get on the sidewalk!&amp;quot;. Yeah, that ain&amp;rsquo;t happening. 16 miles on a sidewalk would not be fun.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got new pavement on Main St in Moncks Corner SC. So nice. The road was in really bad shape. Love cycling on new tarmac.</description>

      <description>Rode across town to Larry&amp;rsquo;s Giant Subs on Old Trolley Rd Summerville SC. Dropped my cheap sunglasses on the road scratching them pretty good. Slammed a turkey sub. Ran into a childhood friend and his son. Good to catch up with him.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a real fan of eating and immediately riding. It was a short ride of 6 miles so wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad but I prefer the restaurants on my side of town.</description>

      <description>I commute twice a week from Summerville to Moncks Corner SC via Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The video was taken during my trial to stay off highways as much as possible. I came out the back of Nexton, through Cane Bay, through Del Webb, onto Black Tom Rd, and finally back onto Hwy 17-A. This route is about 20 miles vs my normal route of 16 miles.</description>

      <description>Cycled to Santee SC Saturday and spent the night at the Holiday Inn. Took Hwy 6 to Santee SC and Hwy 176 on the way home. Hwy 176 is one of my least favorite roads but it is the shortest route. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too busy on Easter Sunday.

      <description>Cycled to Georgetown SC Saturday and spent the night at the Hampton Inn. Saturday was chilly with a headwind. The sun peaked out a few times. Sunday morning it was raining until about checkout time 11 AM. I got on the road and had a nice tailwind home. Not allot a sun but a good ride.
