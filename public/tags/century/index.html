      A mostly clear blue sky made this winter century possible. If it had been overcast I would have cut this ride short. Good day in the saddle.
When you ride 100 miles you can eat what you want. Today I wanted a Veggie Lover Pizza and a beer.

      This ride was on my bucket list. Wanted to make a round trip to Georgetown SC from Summerville SC. Knocked it off the list today. My mother&rsquo;s family is from Georgetown and it holds a special place in my heart and brain. I have many wonderful childhood memories in Georgetown. Now I&rsquo;ve added one more.
Great average temperature of 54℉. It was mostly cloudy. Good to see the sun every now and again.

      Today&rsquo;s century ride was perfect. I even had a little energy left at the end. I&rsquo;m usually spent and struggling by mile 80. I&rsquo;ll attribute feeling good all the way to the end to:
 An abundance of sunshine A lack of headwinds An early start Cool temperatures Nutrition (although I didn&rsquo;t do anything different)
  I went to bed last night excited that today was going to be awesome.

      What a way to start off the new year. A century ride to the beach with temperatures in the 70&rsquo;s °F. Crazy weather and I love it.
The route to Edisto Beach is fairly scenic if you can ignore the roadside litter. There are cypress swamps, marshes, beautiful oak trees, a variety of birds and of course there is the ocean.
Good day on the saddle.

      All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don&rsquo;t have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM.

      It rained before I got on the road and it looked like it was going to be a dreary wet day. Thankfully I was deceived. There was a 3 hour period of weather perfection. The sun was shining and temperatures topped out at 71°F. It was so nice. I removed my sleeves from my jacket and took off my gloves at the beach. When I hit North Charleston the clouds returned along with some wind so I put the sleeves and gloves back on.

      Rode a section of dike on both Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie. Discovered dramatically that the Lake Marion dam is closed to the public. Santee Cooper is South Carolina&rsquo;s state-owned electric and water utility that runs the dam. I was stopped by a Santee Cooper employee and told to turn around. I begged and pleaded for him to let me slide fearing that I may not have the fitness to tackle a 150 mile ride.

My favorite segments were the West Ashley Greenway, Charleston Battery, and Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.
