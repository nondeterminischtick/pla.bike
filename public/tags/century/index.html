      After my first double century I said I&rsquo;ll never do that again. Wrong. Never say never. The memory of how painful that first double century ride faded and I attempted it again. Wanted to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t a fluke. Today&rsquo;s double century ride was tough but not as tough as the first one. Attribute the cooler temperatures for a crampless ride.
Between Jamestown and McClellanville I had dogs chase me, twice!

      Thought about trying another double century but a short and cool December day is not ideal. By 6:00 PM it was 43℉ so I called it a day.
Been a while since I&rsquo;ve ridden Cainhoy Rd. Some of it is pretty scenic.
Refueled at the new Spinx convenience store on the corner of Clements Ferry Rd and Hwy 41. Shot over to the Wando river and then took Hwy 41 to the Santee river.

      Didn&rsquo;t feel like riding a century mentally or physically this morning. Got on the bike anyway to take advantage of this warm weather. Headed out to Ravenel SC and thought about heading home several times but told myself just keep pedaling. As the miles ticked away, the headwind changed to a tailwind and the temperature cracked 70℉, there was no reason to go home. Amazing how that works.
Rode a few new-to-me quiet country roads today.

      Completed my one hundredth century ride. Feels good to accomplish another goal. My first century ride logged on Strava was May 26, 2018.

      Bizarre when your route is a loop and you have a headwind the entire ride. Expected the sun to come out sooner. So glad to see it when it finally did.
The highlight of the ride was getting a leadout by a bald eagle on Cane Gully Rd. Such a magnificent bird. Saw a big owl early in the ride. Also impressive. The most entertaining animal goes to the goat. Saw a couple of pastures with goats.

      Out the door before 4 AM. Saw a couple of deer in Nexton near the same location as last week.
I rode to the Santee Dam. Makes me sad that I can&rsquo;t ride across the dam, legally. It is such a good route to get the Manning. Google Maps navigation still recommends that route. I submitted a flag about it being illegal. The submission probably lands in a bit bucket.

      Goosebumps on my way to the beach. The sun was rising on my left, a full moon was setting on my right, I was surrounded by water, and the smell of pluff mud was permeating the air. Sensory overload.
To beat the heat was on the road at 3:30 AM. Wanted to be on the beach for sunrise but was a few minutes late. The segment from the Intracoastal Waterway to the beach takes much longer than you&rsquo;d think.

Nearly a full moon with a warm orange tint. As the ride progressed the fog lowered which signifies no wind. Yay! It was a moist ride.

Good bit of wind. Sometimes favorable but mostly not.
Crossed paths and momentarily rode with a couple of cyclist from Harleyville. They were must faster than me. I was expecting to find out who they were via Strava Flyby but they must not be on Strava or if they are they don&rsquo;t post publicly.

Recurring theme for Saturday rides is moving at least one turtle off the road. Today&rsquo;s turtle was a little larger than the two last week. As I was telling it to stay off the road it tried to pee on me. Thankfully the stream went between my legs.
I traveled some new-to-me roads: Horseford Rd, Sandridge Rd, Old Beech Hill Rd, and Zion Rd just to name a few.

Crossing the Cooper River I chose the road instead of the multi-use path. There were too many pedestrians and cyclist for the COVID-19 era. I assume it is perfectly legal but probably frowned upon by motorist and police. I survived.

Rode Old Yeller today instead of the single speed. It feels like the rolling resistance is greater on Old Yeller than the Wabi Classic single speed. I think the last couple of century rides on the single speed were easier than today&rsquo;s. The extra gears are nice for bridges and headwinds but if I enjoy riding the single speed more perhaps I just need to toughen up.

      Incredibly nice weather for late October. Mid 80s℉. I&rsquo;ll take it.
Chose to ride Cainhoy Rd instead of Hwy 41 at the last moment. Good decision. Hwy 41 is straight as an arrow, busier, and less scenic than Cainhoy Rd.
Rode thorough Dunes West subdivision to avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41. I haven&rsquo;t memorized the route through Dunes West yet. I tend to doubt my turns. Had to look at my phone a couple of times.

      Up at 3 AM and on the road by 4 AM to beat the post-tropical cyclone Nestor rain. Worked out pretty well. Rain started at mile 90. Still riding the back-up bike. Can&rsquo;t find the correct freehub for Old Yeller.
The only downside was the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market was mostly closed. The vegetable stands were open but the main row with the Cookie Chick didn&rsquo;t open due to Nestor. No cookies for me.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of water access. It is beautiful. Accidentally ran over a black snake&rsquo;s tail. I hope it survived. The trail is a mix of grass, pine straw, downed tree limbs, and roots.

      Didn&rsquo;t have a route planned when I hopped on the bike this morning. I knew I wanted a couple of cookies from the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market. Made a loop around Summerville before heading out to Walterboro. Hwy 17-A is not great.Two lanes, plenty of vehicular traffic at 55+ MPH. I survived the trip there and took a different route home. A strong northerly wind made for a slow ride home. Temperatures were in the 70s ℉ so that was pretty sweet.

      The Santee Coastal Reserve is another hidden gem. The cape is absolutely gorgeous. Water fowl galore and plenty of gators too. As I rode out on the cape, sunning gators would scurry into the water. The most stunning site was a large flock of white egrets or herons flying. A look-out tower near the South Santee River provides breathtaking views.
As far as the ride goes it was great. I started from Moncks Corner instead of Summerville.

While emptying the trash from my jersey pocket at the farmer&rsquo;s market my leg brushed against a poisonous plant. I guess it was poison oak or ivy.

Donnelly WMA is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.

      So nice to be back on Old Yeller. I always enjoy visiting McClellanville. They were having their shrimp festival. I didn&rsquo;t get to partake but did a walk through and then saddled up for a tough ride home.
It is getting pretty warm. My pant legs were covered in salt. I need to start my rides earlier.
Ride on. ☮

      After a nice Saturday in Myrtle Beach it was time for the ride home. Was on the road at 5:04 AM but quickly turned back to get my phone. After that false start the ride was so much nicer than Friday&rsquo;s ride. Very light traffic, no rain, and comfortable temperatures made for a chill ride. It turned overcast around 8:30 but the clouds broke up about 1.5 hours later. There was a persistent light headwind all the way home but hey I&rsquo;m not complaining.

      I knew I was going to get rained on but it was much heavier than anticipated. The rain started at mile 51 and got heavier and heavier. Going over the Waccamaw river bridge in Georgetown the rain felt like needles.
The wind for most of the ride was a favorable cross tailwind. On the easterly section of Saints Delight Rd and coming into Georgetown it was a stiff headwind.
Traffic on Hwy 17 from Georgetown to Myrtle Beach was heavy with plenty of water ponding.

      First time riding on the Lake Marion dike and The Santee Dam. Took me a little while to find the gate to the dike. It was still dark when I arrived. I ended up at Wilson&rsquo;s landing which is several miles from where I needed to be. The entrance to the dike is a yellow gate behind a Santee Cooper garage to the right of the Harry&rsquo;s Fish Camp entrance.

      Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:40 AM. From Summerville I rode through Moncks Corner, Bonneau, St Stephen, Pineville, Cross, Holly Hill, and Harleyville. It was a little chilly this morning until the sun came up. Not looking forward to summer ending.
I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.
At the end of my ride I rode by the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market for some Cookie Chick cookies.

      Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:18 AM. Nice tail wind for 70 miles. Tough head wind on the last leg of the ride. Shifting on Old Yeller is a little slow but other than that she is riding like a champ. Good day in the saddle.

      This is my 4th weekend century in a row. I&rsquo;m getting to the point if I don&rsquo;t ride 100 miles I feel lazy.
Today&rsquo;s ride started at 4:57 AM. Nice to have the roads all to myself for a while. There was a summer shower in West Ashley but the rest of the ride was dry. Good day.

      Rode to Kingstree SC for the second time this year. Traffic was light. Temperatures were pleasant. Wind was calm. Riding a century every weekend is becoming a habit. Not sure why.
For my post ride meal I ate eggs, grits, and toast at Waffle House. It was delicious but pretty much anything tastes good after a century ride. I was expecting Waffle House to be a little livelier it being midnight on a Saturday.

      Mapped out my route Friday night and pretty much stuck to it. This is my third century ride for July 2018. It was a enjoyable ride except for Highway 402. It is the worst road surface I&rsquo;ve ever ridden. I don&rsquo;t think I will ride that highway again until they pave it which will probably be a very long time from now.
My favorite segments were the West Ashley Greenway, Charleston Battery, and Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.

      Frequently I get on my bike without a plan. Today was one of those days.
I do like to ride through Cane Bay on Sunday to check on the progress near Black Tom Rd. So that is were I headed. They have asphalt almost to Black Tom Rd. Looking good.
I then headed towards Moncks Corner and decided to get on the Lake Moultrie dike. Once I got to Bonneau I wanted to find where I could continue on the dike.

      I woke up at 4 AM and was on the road by 5 AM. The rain started at mile 25 and didn&rsquo;t let up much until I returned to Summerville. But hey at least I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about the heat. It was a cool ride in many ways. I love the scenery. Traffic was light for the most part. On the way home when the rain was really coming down a kind human in a pickup truck with a bicycle in the back asked if I wanted a lift.

      Woke up around 3 AM and could not go back to sleep. I knew I wanted to ride a century today and my excitement cost me some sleep. Oh well. I was on the road by 5 AM which was a good thing. The summer is coming on strong. The earlier in the day I ride the better. The entire ride was on 4 lane highways. The traffic was light from home to Kingstree.
