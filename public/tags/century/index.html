      Average temperature was 82℉ with peaks above 90℉. My shorts were covered with salt.
Helped a small turtle cross the road. Saw some goats.
Took a wrong turn off of Calamus Pond Rd. Ended back on Hwy 176, the very road I was trying to avoid. Oh well.
Instead of taking Hwy 52 out of St Stephen I continued on Hwy 45 eventually riding Harristown Rd back to Hwy 17-A. Nice change of scenery.

      Cookie Chick SC is usually at the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market but for now she fulfills online orders on Saturdays in North Charleston starting at 11 AM. The minimum order is a dozen. I was about 45 minutes early so I rode into Hanahan to burn some time.
Picked up my assorted dozen, ate one, and put the rest in the Topeak backloader.
Had a nice tailwind into Charleston. Took the James Island connector over to Maybank Highway.

      Not much to see in Orangeburg but it was a ride I wanted to complete at least once. There is an 8 mile stretch on Hwy 78 that is pretty stressful traffic wise. I dreaded that segment on the way up and back. Things chill out once you get on Hwy 178. The majority of the ride is on Hwy 178.
After taking a spin around Orangeburg I took a wrong turn and asked Google navigation to get me home.

      First time visiting I&rsquo;on Swamp. Scenic ride on a well maintained gravel forestry road. 👍
Crossing the Cooper River I chose the road instead of the multi-use path. There were too many pedestrians and cyclist for the COVID-19 era. I assume it is perfectly legal but probably frowned upon by motorist and police. I survived.
This is the first century ride since March 21, 2020 in which I was exhausted at about mile 50.

Rode Old Yeller today instead of the single speed. It feels like the rolling resistance is greater on Old Yeller than the Wabi Classic single speed. I think the last couple of century rides on the single speed were easier than today&rsquo;s. The extra gears are nice for bridges and headwinds but if I enjoy riding the single speed more perhaps I just need to toughen up.

      Rode up to Lake Marion and around Lake Moultrie. The single speed is perfect when it is flat and the headwinds are gentle. It is tough when climbing hills and bridges. Headwinds are no fun either. I definitively work harder on the Wabi Classic than I do on the Giant Anyroad 1. The simplicity of the single speed is very appealing.

      The Wabi Classic continues to surprise me. The 46/18 gearing is about perfect.

Didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever demote Old Yeller but watch out. The simplicity of the single speed is just so attractive. Fun times.
There was a group of about 6 teenage motorcycle riders on the West Ashley Greenway.

      Didn&rsquo;t think I would log a century ride today. Ride on the Lake Moultrie dike was taxing. It was windy and the trail was spongy from the recent rains.

Many of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s Robinson relatives still reside in Georgetown. Very cool in my book.
The shortest route is 130 miles but returning on the same route is boring so I chose the longer route home.

      The Santee Coastal Reserve is another hidden gem. The cape is absolutely gorgeous. Water fowl galore and plenty of gators too.

A look-out tower near the South Santee River provides breathtaking views.
As far as the ride goes it was great. I started from Moncks Corner instead of Summerville.

      Wow, what a beautiful ride. I was having a hard time deciding where to ride. Decided to explore Rice Hope Plantation and Bonneau Ferry Wildlife Management Area. Good decision. Rode miles of gravel roads. The scenery was off the chart. Truly gorgeous area. To cap the ride off I rode the Lake Moultrie west dike.
I love riding my bicycle.

      I&rsquo;ve been contemplating a ride to Hunting Island, Beaufort, or Savannah GA. I chose today&rsquo;s ride to the Donnelley Wildlife Management Area for more time on Hwy 17. The road surface is not good and traffic is pretty heavy until you get past Jacksonboro SC. A ride to Beaufort is going to be pretty monotonous but it is doable. We&rsquo;ll see.
Donnelly WMA is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.

      Drizzle right from the start of the ride. Actually thought I would have had more rain than I did. The steadiest downpour was around Remount and Rivers in North Charleston. Kinda refreshing.
The highlight of the ride was a huge owl flyby in the Dunes West subdivision. Magnificent animal.
Ride was pleasant. Finished up the ride with a stop at the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market to buy the last two Cookie Chick oatmeal cookies.

      Rode on the beach of Sullivan&rsquo;s Island just before sunrise. Beautiful.
Hopped over to the Isle of Palms and then up the connector to Rifle Range Rd. To avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41 I rode through Dunes West subdivision on Park W Blvd. The route is a little longer but worth avoiding the traffic.
Had a puncture in Moncks Corner SC. Slapped a new tube on, inflated with a CO2 cartridge and was rolling again in no time.

      The Keen sandals were good on the commutes this week so I tried them on a century ride. The sandals worked out well. Instead of my feet being in sweat soaked hot Adidas shoes they were airing out in the wind. 👍👍
I incorrectly thought it was going to be raining all day. There was rain off the coast and I assumed it would be heading inland so I changed my route.

      Double puncture. The first at mile 81 the second at mile 82. Both were staples in the rear tire. On the first puncture I replaced the tube. On the second I used a patch. My mini pump was pretty much useless. I was near a pay pump on the first one and got it rideable. On the second I couldn&rsquo;t get enough air in it to ride so I started walking.

      What a way to start off the new year. A century ride to the beach with temperatures in the 70&rsquo;s °F. Crazy weather and I love it.
The route to Edisto Beach is fairly scenic if you can ignore the roadside litter. There are cypress swamps, marshes, beautiful oak trees, a variety of birds and of course there is the ocean.
Good day on the saddle.

      All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don&rsquo;t have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM.

      It rained before I got on the road and it looked like it was going to be a dreary wet day. Thankfully I was deceived. There was a 3 hour period of weather perfection. The sun was shining and temperatures topped out at 71°F. It was so nice. I removed my sleeves from my jacket and took off my gloves at the beach. When I hit North Charleston the clouds returned along with some wind so I put the sleeves and gloves back on.
