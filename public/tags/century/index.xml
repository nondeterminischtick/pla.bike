      <description>Turning around and going home crossed my mind a couple of times when the cool headwind was like a brick wall. Kept pedaling and it paid off. The second half of the ride the winds were favorable.
Still riding the backup bike but got a call from the bicycle mechanic while I was on Cane Gully Rd that Old Yeller was ready for pickup. There is still work to do but it is rideable.</description>

      <description>Always a pleasure to visit Mepkin Abbey. Moss covered oak trees, green grass and a river. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?
Last night I was going to replace parts on Old Yeller that were damaged last week. Unfortunately one of the screws for the derailleur hanger was stripped. Not having a drill or spare screws the project came to a screeching halt. After this ride on my backup bike I stopped into The Bicycle Shoppe behind my apartment.</description>

      <title>Chill, spill and a whole lotta luck Century 💯</title>

      <description>Took a spill at mile 57. While riding through the Riverfront Park I went from concrete to gravel and tried to get back on the concrete and fell over. The lip of the concrete was higher than I thought and acted like a rail. Fell over onto the concrete on my right side. Injured my hip, elbow and ribs. I could still ride pain free but walking was a different story.</description>

      <description>Bizarre when your route is a loop and you have a headwind the entire ride. Expected the sun to come out sooner. So glad to see it when it finally did.
The highlight of the ride was getting a leadout by a bald eagle on Cane Gully Rd. Such a magnificent bird. Saw a big owl early in the ride. Also impressive. The most entertaining animal goes to the goat. Saw a couple of pastures with goats.</description>

      <description>Super high tide consumed the Botany Bay beach. One of the visitors on the way back said the water was thigh deep on the walk to the beach. Next time I will schedule my trip to Botany Bay during a low tide. Took a few photos and decided to go to Edisto beach. There was water on Palmetto Blvd with police blocking off the flooded section. Took a quick stroll on the beach and headed back home.</description>

      <description>Ride turned out easier than I anticipated. 5 hours of sleep after a pretty active week made me think today was going to be a hard one. Thankfully it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
First time on Doar Rd in Awendaw. Wanted to get to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. Forest Service Rd 260-B was my best bet. Took off down the gravel road and was saddened to see it end before getting to the waterway.</description>

      <description>Whew. This century ride was far less exhausting than Friday&amp;rsquo;s. Main goal was to not repeat Friday&amp;rsquo;s ride. Kept telling myself to slow down. Just take what the road is giving me. So when the headwind stiffened I dropped to a lower gear and maintained my cadence. Felt much better at the end of the ride.
The wildflowers growing on the side of the road were nice. Lots of yellow, blue, and dark red flowers.</description>

      <description>Burned all my matches about 30 miles in and paid for it dearly. Tried a change to my normal route to Edisto Beach. Took Old Jacksonboro Rd off of Hwy 165. This segment runs parallel with Hwy 17 above it. Everything was fine until Old Jacksonboro Rd crossed New Rd. At that point it turned from pavement to a deep soft sand road. My 32c tires sunk in the sand like a hot knife in butter.</description>

      <description>Couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide on today&amp;rsquo;s route. I just headed out the door and made it up as I went. Never felt comfortable with my position and pace but knocked it out. Weather was nice with a little bit of wind.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Rained a good portion of the day. By the afternoon I was sad that the weekend was coming to a close. Thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve never completed consecutive century rides I should try that tonight. Hopped on my bicycle and rode to the beach.
Passed by a yellow Volkswagen beetle broken down on the side of the road. Had to turn around and get a photo with Old Yeller.
Opening CLIF bar packages is frustrating especially when my hands are sweaty.</description>

      <description>Passed a 100 dead Armadillos on the road in the last few years. This morning I had my first live encounter. In Cross SC on Hwy 6 while still dark I thought I was riding up on a possum. It turned out to be an armadillo. We startle each other. I swerved and it danced. Heard its claws tapping on the pavement while it decided like a squirrel on which way to go.</description>

      <description>On the road by 3:40 AM. Heading east on Hwy 402 and Steed Creek roads I could see lightning from an offshore thunderstorm. The stars were bright overhead along with a waning crescent moon. So happy I screamed &amp;ldquo;The universe is mine!&amp;quot;.
After sunrise the clouds moved in and the temperature never rose above 75℉. In hindsight I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to wake up so early.
2020 is more than half over but I finally decided on 4 goals.</description>

      <description>Watched Josh Ibbett&amp;rsquo;s bike check for GBDuro last night. One of his snacks are M&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s. I picked up a small bag at Mac Daddy&amp;rsquo;s in Cross SC. Josh won GBDuro 2020 and I finished my ride so M&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s are a go!
Moved a turtle off Cane Gulley Rd. Has been months since the last time I&amp;rsquo;ve done that. During nesting season I was rescuing turtles every ride. Check out this turtle&amp;rsquo;s stare.</description>

      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Charleston on my bicycle since the rona took off. Good to ride on the West Ashley Greenway again, even during predawn.
Slept a little over 4 hours last night. Woke up tired and never found my mojo but enjoyed riding through Charleston.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Rode to my favorite small town, McClellanville. Out the door at 3:30 AM. Very little wind and pleasant temperatures until the last 1.5 hours made for a pleasant ride.
Felt pretty good after this ride. Wish I could figure out why I&amp;rsquo;m whipped after some century rides. I don&amp;rsquo;t really do anything different but the level of exhaustion varies widely. 🤔
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Out the door before 4 AM. Saw a couple of deer in Nexton near the same location as last week.
I rode to the Santee Dam. Makes me sad that I can&amp;rsquo;t ride across the dam, legally. It is such a good route to get the Manning. Google Maps navigation still recommends that route. I submitted a flag about it being illegal. The submission probably lands in a bit bucket.</description>

      <description>Goosebumps on my way to the beach. The sun was rising on my left, a full moon was setting on my right, I was surrounded by water, and the smell of pluff mud was permeating the air. Sensory overload.
To beat the heat was on the road at 3:30 AM. Wanted to be on the beach for sunrise but was a few minutes late. The segment from the Intracoastal Waterway to the beach takes much longer than you&amp;rsquo;d think.</description>

      <description>Out the door before 4 AM. While still in Nexton had my first encounter with wildlife. Six deer foraging in someone&amp;rsquo;s yard were spooked by my bike and crossed the road in front of me. Neat to hear 12 hooves clacking on the asphalt.
Nearly a full moon with a warm orange tint. As the ride progressed the fog lowered which signifies no wind. Yay! It was a moist ride.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like riding this week after my 200 mile ride Sunday. Started getting the itch to ride last night. Woke up at 3 AM to avoid the heat of the day.
Hoped to see a spectacular sunrise this morning with a Saharan dust plume reaching the coast. Sunrise was nice but not spectacular.
Did see a fox this morning leaving Nexton and a deer a few minutes after the sunrise.</description>

      <description>Riding 200 miles is something that intrigued me and started to haunt me after my 160 mile Georgetown ride. What&amp;rsquo;s 40 more miles, right? A lot. I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any younger so I knocked this goal out while I still can.
Scheduling wasn&amp;rsquo;t wise on my part as it was dangerously hot. Bike computer read 104℉ a couple of times.
The first century went pretty well and was enjoyable. The second century, not so much.</description>

      <description>The morning air was cool and dry for a day in June. Ride started with 3 turkeys and 2 deer showing their faces near Ridgeville. From Ridgeville I traveled through Harleville, Santee, Eutawville, Eutaw Springs, Cross and back home.
Good bit of wind. Sometimes favorable but mostly not.
Crossed paths and momentarily rode with a couple of cyclist from Harleyville. They were must faster than me. I was expecting to find out who they were via Strava Flyby but they must not be on Strava or if they are they don&amp;rsquo;t post publicly.</description>

      <description>Rode to the city where I spent many weekends and holidays as a youth. My mother&amp;rsquo;s side of the family is from Georgetown. Everyone has died or moved away but the city is still near and dear to my heart. Good times.
Heading out of Georgetown I took South Island Rd all the way until it ends at the Yawkey Wildlife Center ferry. It added a couple of miles but it was well worth it.</description>

      <description>Took the single speed for a century ride.
Recurring theme for Saturday rides is moving at least one turtle off the road. Today&amp;rsquo;s turtle was a little larger than the two last week. As I was telling it to stay off the road it tried to pee on me. Thankfully the stream went between my legs.
I traveled some new-to-me roads: Horseford Rd, Sandridge Rd, Old Beech Hill Rd, and Zion Rd just to name a few.</description>

      <description>Rode to one of my favorite towns, McClellanville. Moved a couple of turtles off the road on the way.
Beautiful sunny warm day in the lowcountry. Temperatures ranged from 72℉ to 97℉ according to my bike computer.
This was my 72nd century ride. They ain&amp;rsquo;t getting any easier.
Good day on the saddle.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Average temperature was 82℉ with peaks above 90℉. My shorts were covered with salt.
Helped a small turtle cross the road. Saw some goats.
Took a wrong turn off of Calamus Pond Rd. Ended back on Hwy 176, the very road I was trying to avoid. Oh well.
Instead of taking Hwy 52 out of St Stephen I continued on Hwy 45 eventually riding Harristown Rd back to Hwy 17-A. Nice change of scenery.</description>

      <description>Cookie Chick SC is usually at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market but for now she fulfills online orders on Saturdays in North Charleston starting at 11 AM. The minimum order is a dozen. I was about 45 minutes early so I rode into Hanahan to burn some time.
Picked up my assorted dozen, ate one, and put the rest in the Topeak backloader.
Had a nice tailwind into Charleston. Took the James Island connector over to Maybank Highway.</description>

      <description>Not much to see in Orangeburg but it was a ride I wanted to complete at least once. There is an 8 mile stretch on Hwy 78 that is pretty stressful traffic wise. I dreaded that segment on the way up and back. Things chill out once you get on Hwy 178. The majority of the ride is on Hwy 178.
After taking a spin around Orangeburg I took a wrong turn and asked Google navigation to get me home.</description>

      <description>First time visiting I&amp;rsquo;on Swamp. Scenic ride on a well maintained gravel forestry road. 👍
Crossing the Cooper River I chose the road instead of the multi-use path. There were too many pedestrians and cyclist for the COVID-19 era. I assume it is perfectly legal but probably frowned upon by motorist and police. I survived.
This is the first century ride since March 21, 2020 in which I was exhausted at about mile 50.</description>

      <description>Great weather. Temperatures were mostly in the 80&amp;rsquo;s ℉ although the bike computer read 91℉ at one point.
Had to ride through a controlled burn on Cainhoy Rd. Not a smart thing to be doing during a global pandemic causing respiratory illness.
The Ravenel Bridge and West Ashley Greenway multi-use paths were quite congested. Hopefully sweat and snot rockets were not shared.
Ride on. ☮</description>

      <description>Rather windy on the coast but the temperatures were warm enough to go just jersey, shorts, and sandals. Love it.
Rode the single speed today. Good fun.

      <description>With the time change I was able to squeeze in an afternoon century and get home before dark. Nice!
Rode Old Yeller today instead of the single speed. It feels like the rolling resistance is greater on Old Yeller than the Wabi Classic single speed. I think the last couple of century rides on the single speed were easier than today&amp;rsquo;s. The extra gears are nice for bridges and headwinds but if I enjoy riding the single speed more perhaps I just need to toughen up.</description>

      <description>Rode the not-yet-open Stono River County Park. It is super nice. There is a long board walk across the marsh. The view is beautiful. There is a bicycle repair station too. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen photographs of stations like this one but this is the first one I&amp;rsquo;ve put my hands on. Love it.
It was windy but not as strong as yesterday. I was able to squeeze in a century ride on the Wabi Classic.</description>

      <description>Rode up to Lake Marion and around Lake Moultrie. The single speed is perfect when it is flat and the headwinds are gentle. It is tough when climbing hills and bridges. Headwinds are no fun either. I definitively work harder on the Wabi Classic than I do on the Giant Anyroad 1. The simplicity of the single speed is very appealing. It is also the funnest bike I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden.
Ride on.</description>

      <description>The Wabi Classic continues to surprise me. The 46/18 gearing is about perfect. Getting over bridges and cutting through a headwind is tough but other than that the Wabi Classic feels really good. I&amp;rsquo;m even contemplating making this my main bike. Didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d ever demote Old Yeller but watch out. The simplicity of the single speed is just so attractive. Fun times.
There was a group of about 6 teenage motorcycle riders on the West Ashley Greenway.</description>

      <description>I lost my cycling mojo. Monday I worked late and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like getting up at 4:30 AM Tuesday so I decided to bike to work Wednesday instead. Wednesday morning I got geared-up and headed out for my 20 mile commute. The first 6 miles I was asking myself why am I doing this? It is fricking 31℉ and I&amp;rsquo;m not having any fun. I turned around and went home. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bike to work this week at all.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would log a century ride today. Ride on the Lake Moultrie dike was taxing. It was windy and the trail was spongy from the recent rains. The best segment was on Hwy 45 where I had a nice tailwind. Without that I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made this a century ride. For the first time since Tuesday the temperature was comfortable, hanging around in the 60&amp;rsquo;s℉ for a while.</description>

      <description>Made the most of the mild temperatures by spending all day on the saddle. Rode to my favorite city Georgetown SC. Georgetown is South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s third oldest city behind Charleston and Beaufort. According to Wikipedia it is also the birthplace of former First Lady Michelle Obama&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, Fraser Robinson. Many of Michelle Obama&amp;rsquo;s Robinson relatives still reside in Georgetown. Very cool in my book.
The shortest route is 130 miles but returning on the same route is boring so I chose the longer route home.</description>

      <description>Drove the Chevy Bolt EV to Swansea, SC and parked at the Lexington County Library. Cleared it with the librarian and hit the road on Old Yeller.
First time cycling this part of the South Carolina. Surprised by the amount of urban sprawl around Lake Murray and the hills on this route. With an average temperature of 46℉ I never felt comfortable. The cool wind, hills, and heavy traffic prevented me from relaxing.</description>

      <description>A chilly start at 40℉. On the lake dike it was about 8 degrees warmer. Water is still warm. Nice.
Pretty good ride although I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much punch in my legs so I took it easy.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Incredibly nice weather for late October. Mid 80s℉. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it.
Chose to ride Cainhoy Rd instead of Hwy 41 at the last moment. Good decision. Hwy 41 is straight as an arrow, busier, and less scenic than Cainhoy Rd.
Rode thorough Dunes West subdivision to avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41. I haven&amp;rsquo;t memorized the route through Dunes West yet. I tend to doubt my turns. Had to look at my phone a couple of times.</description>

      <description>Up at 3 AM and on the road by 4 AM to beat the post-tropical cyclone Nestor rain. Worked out pretty well. Rain started at mile 90. Still riding the back-up bike. Can&amp;rsquo;t find the correct freehub for Old Yeller.
The only downside was the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market was mostly closed. The vegetable stands were open but the main row with the Cookie Chick didn&amp;rsquo;t open due to Nestor. No cookies for me.</description>

      <description>A friend suggested I check-out the South Tibwin Hiking Trail so that is what I did today. I had passed the entrance to this trail on my trips to McClellanville but never ventured in. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of water access. It is beautiful. Accidentally ran over a black snake&amp;rsquo;s tail. I hope it survived. The trail is a mix of grass, pine straw, downed tree limbs, and roots.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t have a route planned when I hopped on the bike this morning. I knew I wanted a couple of cookies from the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market. Made a loop around Summerville before heading out to Walterboro. Hwy 17-A is not great.Two lanes, plenty of vehicular traffic at 55+ MPH. I survived the trip there and took a different route home. A strong northerly wind made for a slow ride home. Temperatures were in the 70s ℉ so that was pretty sweet.</description>

      <description>The Santee Coastal Reserve is another hidden gem. The cape is absolutely gorgeous. Water fowl galore and plenty of gators too. As I rode out on the cape, sunning gators would scurry into the water. The most stunning site was a large flock of white egrets or herons flying. A look-out tower near the South Santee River provides breathtaking views.
As far as the ride goes it was great. I started from Moncks Corner instead of Summerville.</description>

      <description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I had it in me today. Knew I was at least going to get a couple of cookies from the Cookie Chick at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market. Made the decision to continue the ride after taking a minute to eat one of the cookies. Glad I pressed on.
While emptying the trash from my jersey pocket at the farmer&amp;rsquo;s market my leg brushed against a poisonous plant. I guess it was poison oak or ivy.</description>

      <description>Oh my. What a hidden treasure. Wee Tee WMA is awesome. You can access it right off of Hwy 17-A north of Santee River. Surprised to see hills surrounding several beautiful lakes. Absolutely beautiful.
My plan was to cut across to St Stephen SC but I ended up back on Hwy 17-A. Not a fan of returning home via the same route so I headed to Andrews SC and caught Hwy 521.</description>

      <description>Wow, what a beautiful ride. I was having a hard time deciding where to ride. Decided to explore Rice Hope Plantation and Bonneau Ferry Wildlife Management Area. Good decision. Rode miles of gravel roads. The scenery was off the chart. Truly gorgeous area. To cap the ride off I rode the Lake Moultrie west dike.
I love riding my bicycle.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating a ride to Hunting Island, Beaufort, or Savannah GA. I chose today&amp;rsquo;s ride to the Donnelley Wildlife Management Area for more time on Hwy 17. The road surface is not good and traffic is pretty heavy until you get past Jacksonboro SC. A ride to Beaufort is going to be pretty monotonous but it is doable. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.
Donnelly WMA is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.</description>

      <description>Drizzle right from the start of the ride. Actually thought I would have had more rain than I did. The steadiest downpour was around Remount and Rivers in North Charleston. Kinda refreshing.
The highlight of the ride was a huge owl flyby in the Dunes West subdivision. Magnificent animal.
Ride was pleasant. Finished up the ride with a stop at the Summerville Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market to buy the last two Cookie Chick oatmeal cookies.</description>

      <description>Rode on the beach of Sullivan&amp;rsquo;s Island just before sunrise. Beautiful.
Hopped over to the Isle of Palms and then up the connector to Rifle Range Rd. To avoid the busiest section of Hwy 41 I rode through Dunes West subdivision on Park W Blvd. The route is a little longer but worth avoiding the traffic.
Had a puncture in Moncks Corner SC. Slapped a new tube on, inflated with a CO2 cartridge and was rolling again in no time.</description>

      <description>The Keen sandals were good on the commutes this week so I tried them on a century ride. The sandals worked out well. Instead of my feet being in sweat soaked hot Adidas shoes they were airing out in the wind. 👍👍
I incorrectly thought it was going to be raining all day. There was rain off the coast and I assumed it would be heading inland so I changed my route.</description>

This. was. an. absolutely. perfect. ride.
Riding over the James Island connector bridge there was a Waning Gibbous moon opposite the rising sun.
Temperatures were warm but not hot, blue sky, light winds, no altercations with automobiles, and I felt great, unlike last Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it can get any better than this but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep trying.</description>

My fortieth century had a brutally tough finish. My legs were cramping and I was running on empty the last two hours of this 8 hour ride. Had to stop to stretch and recover a couple of times. I never had to do that before. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the next 40 less painful century rides. 🍺</description>

      <description>I have seen the Belle Isle Plantation Cemetery sign many times cycling Highway 45. Today I took that turn. This is where Francis Marion and his wife are buried. Also known as The Swamp Fox he was a military officer who served in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). Towards the end of this ride I was in the Francis Marion forest.
It may surprise some but this part of South Carolina has some pretty good roads for riding.</description>

The route to Eutawville was super nice except for the 10 miles on Hwy 176. I started at 5 AM to get off of Hwy 176 as early as possible.</description>

      <description>So nice to be back on Old Yeller. I always enjoy visiting McClellanville. They were having their shrimp festival. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to partake but did a walk through and then saddled up for a tough ride home.
It is getting pretty warm. My pant legs were covered in salt. I need to start my rides earlier.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>After a nice Saturday in Myrtle Beach it was time for the ride home. Was on the road at 5:04 AM but quickly turned back to get my phone. After that false start the ride was so much nicer than Friday&amp;rsquo;s ride. Very light traffic, no rain, and comfortable temperatures made for a chill ride. It turned overcast around 8:30 but the clouds broke up about 1.5 hours later. There was a persistent light headwind all the way home but hey I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining.</description>

      <description>I knew I was going to get rained on but it was much heavier than anticipated. The rain started at mile 51 and got heavier and heavier. Going over the Waccamaw river bridge in Georgetown the rain felt like needles.
The wind for most of the ride was a favorable cross tailwind. On the easterly section of Saints Delight Rd and coming into Georgetown it was a stiff headwind.
Traffic on Hwy 17 from Georgetown to Myrtle Beach was heavy with plenty of water ponding.</description>

      <description>It is starting to heat up. Need to acclimate to the rising temperatures and humidity. Will need to start my rides earlier to beat the heat of the day.
This was my 30th century ride since starting them in May of last year. This one was as tough as any. Somehow I had a headwind most of the ride even though the route was a loop. How is that possible? Perfect timing I guess.</description>

      <description>Spring has sprung. It was chilly this morning but when the 9 o&amp;rsquo;clock hour arrived the temperature rose to the sweet spot.
Loving the new surface on Hwy 402. Cainhoy Rd is pretty scenic for the first half. Clements Ferry Rd, Hwy 41, and Hwy 17 are no fun. Daniel Island is OK if you like big huge fancy houses. I enjoyed the water scenes. A good day. Ride on. ☮</description>

Great day on the saddle. Ride on. ☮

      <description>Had a little bit of rain and a rainbow at the start but the rain moved on and was followed by sunshine and mild temperatures.
The Hwy 17-A Avoidance route to Walterboro gets an A+ for light traffic and scenery but a C- for road surface. The asphalt was rippled, dimpled, cracked, and full of pot holes. Can&amp;rsquo;t have everything.
The Walterboro Wildlife Sanctuary was a nice treat. Good trails and boardwalks over cypress swamps.</description>

      <description>Mist and fog had me wet and cold on the first third of the ride. The air dried as the morning progressed even though it looked like it could rain at any moment.
The last time I rode Hwy 402 the road surface was in terrible shape. They have since resurfaced the road. It is smooth asphalt with a nice size shoulder. There are a couple of sections that have already been repaired.</description>

      <description>Double puncture. The first at mile 81 the second at mile 82. Both were staples in the rear tire. On the first puncture I replaced the tube. On the second I used a patch. My mini pump was pretty much useless. I was near a pay pump on the first one and got it rideable. On the second I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough air in it to ride so I started walking.</description>

Great average temperature of 54℉. It was mostly cloudy. Good to see the sun every now and again.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s century ride was perfect. I even had a little energy left at the end. I&amp;rsquo;m usually spent and struggling by mile 80. I&amp;rsquo;ll attribute feeling good all the way to the end to:
 An abundance of sunshine A lack of headwinds An early start Cool temperatures Nutrition (although I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything different)  I went to bed last night excited that today was going to be awesome. I was not disappointed.</description>

      <description>What a way to start off the new year. A century ride to the beach with temperatures in the 70&amp;rsquo;s °F. Crazy weather and I love it.
The route to Edisto Beach is fairly scenic if you can ignore the roadside litter. There are cypress swamps, marshes, beautiful oak trees, a variety of birds and of course there is the ocean.
Good day on the saddle.

      <description>All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM.</description>

      <description>It rained before I got on the road and it looked like it was going to be a dreary wet day. Thankfully I was deceived. There was a 3 hour period of weather perfection. The sun was shining and temperatures topped out at 71°F. It was so nice. I removed my sleeves from my jacket and took off my gloves at the beach. When I hit North Charleston the clouds returned along with some wind so I put the sleeves and gloves back on.</description>

      <description>Rode a section of dike on both Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie. Discovered dramatically that the Lake Marion dam is closed to the public. Santee Cooper is South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s state-owned electric and water utility that runs the dam. I was stopped by a Santee Cooper employee and told to turn around. I begged and pleaded for him to let me slide fearing that I may not have the fitness to tackle a 150 mile ride.</description>

The middle section of the ride was good. Warmed up into the 60&amp;rsquo;s with mostly a tail wind. Rode some gravel, rock, and mud on Tiger Corner Rd in the Francis Marion Forest.

Not a cloud in the sky all day long. I donned arm warmers and gloves this morning. It was a good decision. Temperature started at 50.0 °F and maxed out at 84.2 °F according to Garmin.

I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.

      <description>Rode to Kingstree SC for the second time this year. Traffic was light. Temperatures were pleasant. Wind was calm. Riding a century every weekend is becoming a habit. Not sure why.
For my post ride meal I ate eggs, grits, and toast at Waffle House. It was delicious but pretty much anything tastes good after a century ride. I was expecting Waffle House to be a little livelier it being midnight on a Saturday.</description>

      <description>Mapped out my route Friday night and pretty much stuck to it. This is my third century ride for July 2018. It was a enjoyable ride except for Highway 402. It is the worst road surface I&amp;rsquo;ve ever ridden. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ride that highway again until they pave it which will probably be a very long time from now.
My favorite segments were the West Ashley Greenway, Charleston Battery, and Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.</description>

      <description>Frequently I get on my bike without a plan. Today was one of those days.
I do like to ride through Cane Bay on Sunday to check on the progress near Black Tom Rd. So that is were I headed. They have asphalt almost to Black Tom Rd. Looking good.
I then headed towards Moncks Corner and decided to get on the Lake Moultrie dike. Once I got to Bonneau I wanted to find where I could continue on the dike.</description>

      <description>Woke up around 3 AM and could not go back to sleep. I knew I wanted to ride a century today and my excitement cost me some sleep. Oh well. I was on the road by 5 AM which was a good thing. The summer is coming on strong. The earlier in the day I ride the better. The entire ride was on 4 lane highways. The traffic was light from home to Kingstree.</description>
