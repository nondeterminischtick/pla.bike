      <description>Busy week at work. So nice to let off some steam on the ride home. Looking forward to the weekend. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll ride my bicycle.
Good commute.

      <description>Witnessed a colorful sunrise and enjoyed a strong tailwind on the way home, averaging 20 mi/h. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen without a tailwind.
Great commute.

      <description>Rode my backup bicycle today, Giant Defy 3. Nothing wrong with Old Yeller. Just giving the backup a little attention.
Spotted a turtle trying to cross four lanes of Hwy 17-A. No way it would have survived that crossing. I carried it, legs flailing, to the edge of the woods and told it to have a good evening.
Good commute.

      <description>46℉ this morning. Pretty chilly for the middle of May. Persistent pesky headwind on the way to work. Favorable wind on the way home.
Starting my commute an hour later seems to be working out OK. Still finishing my breakfast by the time 8 AM rolls around. Waking up at 5:30 AM instead of 4:30 AM makes a big difference.
Good commute.

      <description>Trying out a later start. I was getting up around 4:30 AM, getting to work before 6:00 AM, cooling down, eating breakfast and changing clothes. All that was done before others arrived at the office. There are some advantages to starting early like less automobile traffic and privacy when you are the first to arrive at the office. The down side is getting up so dang early and leaving work at 4 PM when there is always someone needing something at the end of the day from me.</description>

      <description>Late night working Wednesday. Was going to sleep late and drive my car to work but woke up early enough for a bike commute.
Good one.

      <description>Rain all week, sunny and cool on the weekend is this year&amp;rsquo;s weather pattern. Enough already.
Another sloppy ride home. Still better than sitting on my butt in a car.
Morning commute was pleasant.

      <description>Awoke to a 4 AM thunderstorm. Showered up and hit the road after the worst of the rain had passed. Wet and sloppy AM and PM commutes. At least the temperatures were on both sides of 60 ℉.
Sure wish they would pave a road connecting Black Tom Rd to Cane Bay. That segment is a mud fest.
Good commute.

      <description>The weather forecast is not looking great this week. Rain every day with a cold snap towards the weekend. Given that forecast I decided to bike to work on a Monday. Luckily I dropped off a pair of work outfits last Friday.
This morning on the dirt section near Black Tom Rd a pigeon and I had a close encounter. We both startled each other equally. I sure wish they would pave that last section so I could hop on Black Tom Rd without getting muddy.</description>

      <description>Started out on Old Yeller but the rear wheel locked up after a few miles. Reseated the rear wheel and hobbled home. Got on the single speed and headed back out.
We broke an 81 year old record today with a high temperature of 80℉. Love it!

      <description>Nice strong tailwind this morning made for an easy AM commute. Rainy headwind on the way home made was a little more adventurous. At least the temperatures were warm, mid to upper 60&amp;rsquo;s℉.
Saddled the single speed today. That bike is a blast to ride.

      <description>AM 40&amp;rsquo;s and PM 60&amp;rsquo;s℉. Nice. New jersey day too. Yay! The zippers on the old jersey wore out. I dropped it off by a seamstress before Christmas. Haven&amp;rsquo;t heard a thing from her. Checked on it a couple of times already. Crickets.

      <description>On my. This is a fun bike to ride. The single speed Wabi Classic arrived yesterday. Assembled and test ridden last night. Rode it work work today. I was a little apprehensive that it might be too tough for this old man to ride. Turns out the 46/18 gearing is just about perfect for the flat lowcountry. Speedy yet not spinny. Tough up a hill but not too tough. It might be too tough in a strong headwind.</description>

      <description>Making the most of this warm weather. Forecast a week from now is for below freezing temperatures.
Installed, poorly, a saddle I had laying around last night (Specialized Elaston). Came loose riding over a rock construction entrance about 8 miles from work. Rode it in like that. Was out of the saddle a good bit. Got it sorted for my lunch ride and commute home.
Good commute.

      <description>Ordered a fisheye lens from Amazon a couple of days ago and shipped it to work. Carried my DSLR to work today anticipating delivery of the lens. Arrived a few minutes before the end of my work day. Took a few snaps on the way home. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to like the fisheye lens. You can get really close to the subject and still capture everything. Nice.
Commute was great.</description>

      <description>Today I met my goal of 10,000 miles riding my bicycles in 2019. Feels good. 585 hours of good old fashioned fun.
Not sure what my goal will be for 2020. Probably won&amp;rsquo;t be distance related.
Commute this morning was 21 miles in the twenties. The lowest temperature was 25℉. Chilly for this southern boy.

Afternoon ride was good but windy. 65 miles for the day. I&amp;rsquo;ll take it.

Right wrist is slowing healing. Have a couple of saddle sores from Saturday&amp;rsquo;s 150 mile ride but no biggie. Looking forward to the 4 day Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

      <description>36℉ on the way to work and 55℉ on the way home with plenty of sunshine. Saturday&amp;rsquo;s temperature should top out in the 70s. Looking forward to it.
My right wrist is feeling better but not fully healed from my century ride around Lake Murray. Minimizing my gear shifting to aid the healing process.
Broke 9,000 miles for 2019. Need to knock out 1,000 more in the next 40 days to reach my goal of 10k.</description>

      <description>41℉ on the AM commute and a sunny 53℉ on the PM commute. The weather has turned the corner away from rain and clouds to some sun. Pretty good day.
My right wrist is still not healed from Saturday&amp;rsquo;s century ride around Lake Murray. Come on. Hurry it up already.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Feel pretty wimpy for leaving work at noon to beat the cold rain. Tonight it will dip down into the upper 20&amp;rsquo;s℉. Bah, humbug. It is going to be a challenge to get miles in with this rainy cold weather. I just need to toughen up. This weather is pretty tame compared to other locations.
My right wrist is swollen and sore from Saturday&amp;rsquo;s century ride around Lake Murray. I think because I changed gears so much due to the hills.</description>

      <description>No tricks this week. All good except for a lady yelling at me to ride the bicycle path. I would if there was one from Moncks Corner to Summerville.
October is done and dusted. It has been a warm one and I&amp;rsquo;ve loved it. This morning started off in the 70&amp;rsquo;s℉. Tomorrow morning will be 30 degrees cooler. Boo.

Old Yeller is performing well. Need to replace the splitting foam grips on my handlebars before Thursday&amp;rsquo;s commute.

      <description>After a couple of weeks of acquiring tools, parts, and knowledge I have Old Yeller back on the road. Replaced the slipping freehub with a new one last night. Rode Old Yeller to work today. Super nice. Good tailwind home. Average speed 20 MPH.
Took several days of research to find the correct freehub, SRAM MTH 506. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard.
Whip it good

Current gear issues:

      <description>Another week on the backup bike. I received two hex wrenches today. They were supposed to be both 11 mm. One of them was a 10 mm. Glad I ordered two. Removed the freehub and if I get the correct one tomorrow I might be riding Old Yeller Saturday. Rain or shine.
Good commute this week. I had a family gathering after work today so I put a little extra effort in the ride home.</description>

      <description>Riding the backup bike while I try to figure out freehub replacement on Old Yeller. Better figure it out soon because my backup bike is missing a spoke in the rear wheel.
Gave some thought of buying the Giant Contend AR 1 2020 as the geometry and components are fairly close to my Giant Anyroad 1 but that is not the proper thing to do. Keep repairing Old Yeller until the frame snaps in two.</description>

Back on the Defy 3. The Anyroad 1 has a slipping freehub. It&amp;rsquo;s always something.

      <description>Chain is worn. Skips when I get out of the saddle. Gonna replace it Friday night. Probably will ride another century Saturday for the 15th consecutive weekend.
Commute was good. New PM route is working out good. If they can get that exit off of Black Tom Rd paved it would be ace.

      <description>Looking forward to a paved road from Cane Bay to Black Tom Rd. As of this post it is still a construction zone. Probably the toughest part of this route.
On the PM commute I had a water truck tailing me into a round-a-bout and I took the first out instead of the second. Before I realized what I had done I was half way to a dead end. Ended up in the woods again.</description>

      <description>Took the multi-use path in Cane Bay until it ended. Tried to get back on track by cutting through the woods. Ended up on Hwy 176 in front of the under construction Nexton Parkway. Hopped on the gravel and headed home. Made the PM commute almost 22 miles. Cool.

      <description>The new PM route through Cane Bay is growing on me. Really the only sketchy part is Black Tom Rd. Getting off of Black Tom Rd and into Cane Bay is a little precarious too. The entrance is lined with golf ball size rocks, then sand, and finally a construction machinery crossing. Once I hit the pavement it is good. The automobile traffic picks up the closer I get to Hwy 176.</description>

      <description>Took the usual route in the AM and a different route in the PM. Entered the back of Cane Bay via Black Tom Rd. The difference is a toss up. Hwy 17-A, the usual route, is busy but at least it is 4 lanes. Black Tom Rd is only two lanes with trucks and cars that won&amp;rsquo;t slow down for a cyclist. The Cane Bay route is about 5 miles longer which isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal but the chance of getting hit by a motor vehicle is about the same on both routes.</description>

      <description>Uneventful commute this week. I gnashed my shin with my pedal at a traffic light. Bled like a fountain. Other than that it was a quiet week. Looking forward to the weekend. Probably knock out a century Saturday.
Sunday I have an appointment to see a cottage at Nexton. The new line of homes are supposed to be smaller than the mansions they normally build. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get out of this apartment one day.</description>

All good with my commute. I didn&amp;rsquo;t die.
My 10k goal is on track. Cracked 7K this weekend. Currently at 7,065 towards my goal of 10,000 quality cycling miles in 2019.

      <description>Hurricane Dorian is taking its time getting to South Carolina. Expecting a brush-by on Thursday so I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll commute by bike on Thursday.

      <description>I am a creature of habit. Work Monday through Friday, bike commute on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I eat lunch at Subway every weekday. The veggie spinach wrap is awesome. That wrap with an unsweet iced tea is probably my favorite meal. Refreshing and tasty.
Just think of how many problems we could solve if everyone adopted a plant based diet.

      <description>Nice commute. The ride home was cooler for an August afternoon. We had a few rain showers around noon which helped keep temperature below normal.
I am determined more than ever to meet my 10,000 mile goal for 2019. Chipping away at my pace deficit. I am at 6,253 which is 102 miles behind pace. Hoping that the Labor day holiday will get me ahead of pace. Onwards and upwards!</description>

      <description>Old Yeller fresh from the LBS is shifting like a Ford Pinto low on transmission fluid. What a way to start the day. The rear derailleur had a mind of its own. Shifting and skipping when it felt like it. Frustrating! My LBS let me down big time. I&amp;rsquo;m going to see what I can do with it tomorrow after work. The weekend is here it is time to ride.</description>

Commute was good. The ride home was a smoking hot 95°F. Looking forward to the Thursday commute on Old Yeller. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as hot and there is also a higher chance of rain.</description>

      <description>Old Yeller is getting a new drivetrain. Riding the Defy 3 until I get back my main bike which hopefully will happen before the weekend.
Strong headwind on the way home. Change in the weather is coming. A little less heat and some rain.
Good commute.
Ride on. ☮

      <description>Spotted a fox running across the parking lot this morning. Always a pleasant surprise.
Another hot one on the way home, 93 °F. Good commute.
After dinner I tried my first GU Energy Stroopwafel. 👍👍 Should be a good fuel on the bike.

      <description>First day back on the bike since my 120 mile ride Saturday. I needed a couple of days to recover from that tough, tough, century ride.
Hot ride home. Maximum temperature according to Garmin was 95 °F. Good commute.
Checked my mileage goal. I have 5,239 of my goal of 10,000 miles in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m 158 miles behind pace.

      <description>Good commute to work. Ride home was tough with temperatures in the 90&amp;rsquo;s °F with persistent headwind. Still better than driving.
Received an email today from Strava and Relive today. Relive can no longer use the Strava API. They reportedly violated several terms of the API. Relive made some software changes recently and made it much easier to create a video with their service. In addition to the tracking data Relive started transferring the title and photos from Strave.</description>

      <description>Saw Ms. Fox this morning hanging out on Stony Landing Rd. Really cool animals. Hopefully her 2 friends are doing OK. Didn&amp;rsquo;t see them today.
Great commute. Rained after lunch which provided a cooler than normal ride home. Sweet.

      <description>Saw 3 foxes on Stony Landing Rd probably searching for rabbits. Would have loved to see the footage but my GoPro Hero6 is failing more than succeeding lately.
Sloppy start in the AM. It had just finished raining in Summerville. As I got closer to Moncks Corner it was dry as a Arizona bone. Kinda warm on the ride home, 93°F.

      <description>Before getting on the road home it rained a little bit. Temperatures were lower than usual. Made for a pleasant ride home.
Replaced my ridiculously over priced rear view mirror. The old one was dark in spots and generally hazy. Enjoyed a better view during today&amp;rsquo;s commute.
I joined the Rails To Trails Conservancy a few weeks ago. Received a t-shirt, magazine and sticker today. 👍

After work, against my better judgment, I ate at Taco Boy on opening day. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t too crazy. Had a couple of vegan tacos and a Dos Equis. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any local brews on tap. I&amp;rsquo;ll go back after the newness wears off.

      <description>Part of Hwy 17-A approximately between Cypress Garden Rd and Black Tom Rd is getting resurfaced. I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice anything wrong with the tarmac at least not in the area they are working on. Closer to Summerville the top of the asphalt is coming up big time. Will be interesting to see if this project goes that far. I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining. Any new tarmac is welcomed.

      <description>Another weather lucky day. I woke at 3 AM looked at the radar and said I can get to work before that rolls in.
The afternoon rain looked to almost be stationary to the south.
Another rain free commute. And for a bonus I had a rare tailwind on the ride home. Made pretty good time.

      <description>Four straight days of 100℉. Thankfully there was some cloud cover on my way home. The Garmin recorded a high of 99℉.
While on Hwy 17-A nearing Summerville I had someone sitting on their horn. I assume their anger was directed towards me. It was kinda of comical when I passed the car while it was waiting on traffic. They blew their horn the second time behind me. I really don&amp;rsquo;t see what the big deal is.</description>

Good commute today. On Stony Landing Rd this morning a rabbit was being squirrely and almost ended up in my spokes. It changed directions and disaster was averted.

      <description>Morning routine is wake-up 4:30 AM, check radar, shower, dress, and cycle to work. This morning I pretended I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the radar. There was a line of rain headed my way. I chose to ride anyway. Just a little bit of rain on sections of the ride. No biggie. I kept thinking about my Good Friday ride to Myrtle Beach in the rain. Nothing will compare to that downpour.</description>

      <description>The local newspaper published a depressing story on how dangerous our state is for pedestrians and bicyclists. Not that I need a reminder. I question my sanity every day but continue to ride.
Had a nice chat with a neighborhood cyclist who just moved here from New Jersey. He works at Volvo and is a couple of years older than me. He was wondering where all the cyclists were. I told him about a couple of group rides.</description>

      <description>The commute was good but afterwards was better. I picked up Old Yeller from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes. I got a new Shimano Tiagra derailleur and a cable, for free. It was free because the derailleur hanger snapped Saturday and destroyed the derailleur. Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes has 30 day warranty on repair work. 👍 This is on top of the new cassette and chain from maintenance the week before. I paid for that work.</description>

      <description>While on the ride home Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bike called to tell me my Giant Anyroad 1 was ready. After a quick shower I bolted down to Folly Rd to pick Old Yeller™ up and drop off the Defy to get the rear wheel trued.
Looking forward to hopping back on Old Yeller and its new drivetrain.
Oh yeah. Good commute today. More great weather.

Another beautiful day in the lowcountry for all outdoor activities. I was on the road at 4:13 AM. Very little traffic at that time in the morning and what traffic there is seems to be a little more laid-back. Did I mention how great the weather is. Good commute. Ride on.</description>

      <description>I was thinking in the shower about bicycle commuting. It takes some effort.
 Get up 2 hours early to avoid morning traffic Take 2 showers instead of 1 Bicycle 32 miles (this is the good part) Risk life cycling with automobiles Battle the elements: wind, rain, heat, and cold  This morning was in the 30&amp;rsquo;s℉. I thought we were done with the 30&amp;rsquo;s. Oh well it was almost 70℉ on ride home.</description>

      <description>Misty morning and clear afternoon. Pretty good commute if I forget about bubba babbling about getting off the road or end up in pieces. Jeez. 98% of automobile drivers behave properly. About once a day some dude, usually in a truck, has to tell me to get off the road. This time the passenger opened his door on Hwy 17-A and yelled. Stay classy bubba. Oh well. Ride on. ☮</description>

      <description>Cool, strong, headwind this morning had me contemplating why I ride my bike to work when I have a perfectly good electric vehicle. The tail/crosswind on the way home made me forget all about the struggle I had 11 hours earlier.
Had blast on the ride home. Spliced the slightly interesting video clips together with Kdenlive. Good commute. Ride on. ☮

      <description>I have named my Priority 600 The Beast. It is big, heavy, and hard to move. Don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was tired legs, headwind, The Beast or all of those things that made the ride home tough.
Regardless, I survived. Ride on. ☮

      <description>Beautiful weather today made for an enjoyable commute. Except for bubba yelling at me to get off the f&amp;rsquo;ing road at Black Tom Rd &amp;amp; Hwy 17-A intersection it was a chill ride home.
My Anker 10,000mAh battery only lasted about 5 months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to charge it for 3 days without luck. The way I mount it on my bike it catches sweat so the connectors are corroded. Probably will buy another and flip it upside down this time.</description>

      <description>Chilly start. Temperatures were in the twenties this morning. Super nice this afternoon. Clear blues skies and mild temperatures.
This is the second commute on my Priority 600 with Pinion gearbox. While I&amp;rsquo;m riding the 600 I keep bemoaning the resistance I feel compared to Old Yeller. The commute takes about 5 minutes longer on the 600. I need to get over the added weight and resistance. Riding to lunch and dinner on the 600 is perfect.</description>

      <description>Intrigued at the prospect of fewer drivetrain issues I bought a Priority 600 with a Pinion gearbox. Assembled last night and rode to work today. Initial reaction is it is a smooth ride but slow. The rolling resistance with the big 650b tires is noticeable as well as the resistance of the belt drive. At this point I don&amp;rsquo;t see it replacing Old Yeller. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to get rid of the Defy 3 though.</description>

      <description>The low temperature on the PM commute (41℉) was cooler than the AM commute (44℉). The wind was kicking all day. Headwind on the AM ride and a tailwind on the way home. Difference of 14 minutes. Always happy with a sub 50 minute commute. 1:02:53 vs 49:04 moving time.
Became an East Coast Greenway Alliance member today. I would love to safely cycle from Charleston to Beaufort one day. 🤞</description>

      <description>Southeastern Wildlife Exposition (SEWE) started today. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stay clear of downtown Charleston tomorrow.
Mild winter continues. Another good commute.
Another restaurant chain in Summerville, Culver&amp;rsquo;s. Never eaten at one. Glanced at the menu. Meh. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be frequenting Culver&amp;rsquo;s.
Ride on.

      <description>Happy to be riding Old Yeller again. Much more comfortable than the Defy 3. Speaking of which I picked up the Defy 3 from my LBS yesterday. They installed a new drive train and new tires. It now has 28&amp;rsquo;s instead of 25&amp;rsquo;s so it should be a little more comfortable.
Good commute today. Foggy this morning. Warm and windy on the way home. Ride on.

      <description>Another warm day. 75℉ on the ride home with a stiff head wind. Good commute on the Defy 3. Ride on.
My LBS called about Old Yeller. The rear brake caliper is weak. They are going to replace it but not with a stock Giant caliper. Parts are ordered. The tech said they might be in tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;m betting it will be Monday. These extended maintenance events are frustrating.

      <description>Absolutely perfect weather. Highs in the 70&amp;rsquo;s and clear blue sky. What a way to start the Year of the Pig.
I almost ran over a rabbit. One hopped out in front of me on Hwy 17-A. I missed it by inches. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear a thud so I assume and hope it got across the highway safely.
Good commute. Lets do it again tomorrow. Ride on.

      <description>The weather forecast called for rain around 5PM which would have been perfect if I left by 4PM. By lunch time I knew the rain was going to be here sooner than that. I left work a couple hours early to beat the rain. Drizzled most of the way home but no downpour. Stiff headwind accompanied the drizzle. Not one of my best commutes.
Thursday&amp;rsquo;s forecast calls for a low of 28℉.</description>

      <description>32℉ this morning. 48℉ and mostly sunny on the way home. Good commute.
Called Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes about my creaking steering. They are ordering parts and will call me when they are in to try to minimize my down time. I appreciate that.

Schedule is off this week due to Monday&amp;rsquo;s holiday. Tomorrow morning&amp;rsquo;s forecast is rain with wind gusts of 57 mph so I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll drive the Bolt EV. Friday is looking good though. Ride on.

      <description>According to my Garmin it was 26℉ this morning and 64℉ on the way home. Guess which segment I enjoyed more?
On the way home I was passed, at a high rate of speed, by a couple of dozen police vehicles with sirens blaring. They were mostly Berkeley County Sheriff vehicles. The others were unmarked. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what was going down but I assume it was pretty serious.
Looking forward to the 3 day weekend.</description>

      <description>Another overcast chilly January day. Low of 33°F this morning. The traffic lights were not kind this morning. I was stopped by every one of them heading out of Summerville. It is hard to stay warm when you are waiting on traffic signals.
Winds were calm which was welcomed.
Ride on.

Left the apartment this morning with two left hand gloves. Didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to go back. No gloves necessary. The ride home was sloppy. Rained periodically throughout the day. No rain on the way home though. Ride on!

      <description>The wind was whipping today nearly knocking me over a few times.
Even with an awesome tailwind I can&amp;rsquo;t snag a KOM. There are Strava 3 segments on the way to work. I am 2nd, 3rd, and 4th on the all time rankings. I thought today I might get my first KOM but I was still 34 seconds slower than the leader on the smaller of the 3 segments. Oh well, the ride to work was a lot of fun.</description>

I was on the road by 4:46 AM. Waking up so early is tough but totally worth missing rush hour traffic. So much safer and less stressful. Ride on.

      <description>There was a down power line across Hwy 17-A this morning. Firemen secured the area. I took a detour onto Horseshoe Rd.
On the commute home I got a work alarm had to deal with. Not a very smooth commute either way. Oh well. The weather was good.

      <description>Moncks Corner put out there Christmas decorations just in time for Thanksgiving.
Commute was good. Traffic was a smidgen lighter due to the upcoming holiday. I have a 4 day weekend. Too bad the best weather day is Thanksgiving day. I&amp;rsquo;ll squeeze in some miles between the rain showers.
New lighter colored carpet was installed in my place of employment. I purchased a mat for my office where I park my bike in the bikehand.</description>

      <description>This must be what riding a penny-farthing feels like. My new bike fit has me higher and more upright. Felt like my quadriceps were working harder today. So far, so good.
Windy day. Head wind on the way to work and tail wind on the way home. 16.4 MPH vs 21.3 MPH. Enjoyed the ride home 100 times more than the ride to work. There was rain to our northwest and offshore but not a drop in Moncks Corner or Summerville.</description>

      <description>Mild temperatures. Winds kicking as a cold front approaches. Good commute.

      <description>Low temperature this morning was 41.0 °F. I donned my Gore jacket, Gore gloves, and Five Ten MTB shoes. All good.
Looking forward to rolling into the weekend. Tomorrow is looking like a rainy day. Saturday and Sunday should be rain free. Ride on.

      <description>Nothing special about today&amp;rsquo;s commute. I was feeling cool air blowing into my shoe this morning. I guess it about time for some new ones. I have some Five Ten MTB bike shoes that have a nice hard sole but they are heavy. I may give them another try.

      <description>Thursday tropical storm Michael was passing to the west of us. I contemplated riding to perhaps get a tail wind assisted KOM but I came to my senses. I drove my EV to work yesterday and cycled today.
55.4 °F was the low temperature during my AM commute. I don&amp;rsquo;t like what is coming. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all. I rather sweat than freeze any day. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long before the Gore jacket and gloves are needed.</description>

      <description>Nice weather. Productive week at work so far. Two good commutes and 64 miles logged. Looking forward to the weekend. Not sure where I&amp;rsquo;m riding but I&amp;rsquo;m riding.
Upgraded my Garmin 520 to version 12.80. It wiped out my settings. Most importantly my sensors. I had to set the sensors up again. Software upgrades should not wipe out user settings. First world problems.
Rock on!

      <description>For what I assume was for Fire Prevention Week Whitesville FD was hanging old glory above Hwy 17-A on the Moncks Corner side of Carnes Crossroads. Thank-you fire fighters!
Glad I was riding my bike. Automobile traffic was a CF. Good commute.

      <description>Grant Ford wrote Morning Trek for me in return for a small donation towards his writing projects. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my return on investment. It captures some of the joys of cycling.
#Morning Trek A breath of cool air, the smell of pavement entrance and entice the morning senses with freedom from the daily enslavement of cars and trucks and motorized fences. With the strength of will, the body exerts upon the gears of destiny and fate to consume the miles combustion preverts; you breathe the clean air, your spirit to sate.</description>

      <description>It was pouring down rain around 4 AM. I went back to sleep and when I awoke at 5 AM the rain had stopped. I checked RadarScope. There were storms to the south and to the north but nothing between Summerville and Moncks Corner so I stuck to my plan. The road was wet but not a drop of rain fell on me. RadarScope is awesome. Good ride to work. A couple of hours later my back tire went flat.</description>

      <description>Traffic was light with Hurricane Florence heading towards the southeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. I wish the traffic was this light everyday.
The cover photo for today&amp;rsquo;s log was taken on the way back from dinner. It is I-26 exit 199 with all lanes heading west to Columbia SC. Lane reversals started at noon September 11, 2018.

      <description>There was a fatal automobile accident at the Black Tom Rd and Hwy 17-A intersection this morning. Rest in ☮. I reached the scene about 20 minutes afterwards. The police had the intersection taped off. All traffic was diverted. I was able to cycle around the barrier and get to work.
My Topeak backloader bag was not strapped as tight as it should have been and sounded like a frog for most of the AM commute.</description>

      <description>Cycling yields quality spirits. I am happy with the way the photo in front of Watkins Package Store developed. 📷 It was a split decision to take a photo here. So much so I almost wipe out when I turned off the road into a sand mound. Crisis averted and photo snapped.
Up at 5 AM and pedaling by 5:21 AM. Had a head wind on the way to work and a tail on the way home.</description>

      <description>Made it to work in 46 minutes thanks to a tail wind. The wind didn&amp;rsquo;t shift during the day so I had a stiff head wind on the way home. The wind giveth and taketh away.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t commuted on the bike lately in lieu of evening rides. This commute was a little different in that I carried my clothes to work in my Topeak Backloader bag. Normally I store clothes in my office when I drive the EV.</description>

      <description>The Garmin 520 recorded 59°F as the low temperature. That is crazy low for July. I almost needed my arm warmers. High temperature on the ride home was 86℉ which was pleasant.
I must admit waking up before 5 AM to beat the traffic is getting old. Still waiting on a road to connect to Black Tom Rd that may provide a safer and later ride.

      <description>Rode the bicycle to work since I dropped off my Chevy Bolt EV yesterday for scheduled maintenance. Left work a little after 3PM and cycled to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet in Charleston to pick up the Bolt. There was a heat advisory and a headwind. The Garmin recorded 100.4 °F as the high and 94.0 °F as the average. Not sure what the humidity was but it was high. I faced a headwind today which I guess is fair since I had a tailwind yesterday.</description>

      <description>Good ride into work in under 50 minutes moving time. Always pleased with sub 50 minute rides. The ride home had a rain delay. Planned to leave work at 4 PM but a shower popped up and rained pretty hard. Worked for another hour. The road was steaming for the first few miles and all dry the rest of the way home. After showering I cycled over to Taco Bell for some black bean burritos.</description>

      <description>Long day. Woke up at 4:00 AM and was on the road by 5:00 AM. Left the office around 5:20 PM.
My bike has a clicking squeaky noise. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it is from the saddle. Took the saddle off and removed a good bit of dirt. Hopefully that was cause.
Temperatures are on the way up. It was approaching 90 ℉. May 2018 was the wettest month ever in Charleston SC.</description>

      <description>Rain and more rain. As of this writing this is second wettest May of all time for Charleston SC. Bring on a dry hot June.
I brought my Nvidia Shield to work for a coworker to borrow. I packed it in my Topeak Backloader bicycle bag and it stayed dry. Yay! I was able to cycle to lunch without getting rained. Yay again! The ride home was a soaker but at least the winds were calm and the temperature was a comfortable 69.</description>

      <description>Tried a new route on the morning commute. I got off of Hwy 17-A at Gaillard Rd over to Old Hwy 52. Nice change of scenery. It was not quite a mile longer.
The afternoon commute got off to a slow start. Before I could work up a sweat I was stopped by not one but two trains. The first freight train was long and slow. Towards the end with just a dozen cars left to pass the crossing a second freight train coming from the opposite direction appeared.</description>

We had on and off again rain all day. I managed to escape all but a few drops here and there. Pretty nice rides. Below is a snippet of my ride home.

      <description>Picked up Old Yeller from Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes yesterday. It has a new rear derailleur, chain, rear tire, and cassette. The ride to work was super smooth. Really glad to have the Giant Anyroad 1 back. It is so much nicer than my backup bike, Giant Defy 3. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall an average MPH of 20 so I think this was a personal best. There is something motivational about a new drivetrain.</description>

      <description>Thursday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I rode to Chipotle for dinner and afterwards rode up Hwy 78. I was going to take N Maple St to the Nexton Parkway but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find N Maple St. Looked at Google Maps when I got home and realized I should have traveled a few more blocks. I headed back up 17-A and took Holiday Dr to Nexton Parkway instead. Even though I had been on Nexton Parkway many times this was the first time with automobile traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I snapped a photo of The Corner Cafe Bakery in Moncks Corner SC. It recently closed. A Starbucks recently opened and I assume that might have played into The Corner&amp;rsquo;s decision to close. I had a rare tailwind on the way home which enabled me to break my 50 minute barrier again. Nice!

      <description>Wheee - just having fun! Gorgeous weather continues. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the way my rear hub was sounding so I dropped off my Giant Anyroad 1 bike at Mike&amp;rsquo;s Bikes in Mt Pleasant. Asked them to check all the bearings. Hopeful it will be a one day turn around so I can have it for the weekend. If not I&amp;rsquo;ll be riding my Giant Defy 3 and wishing I was on my Anyroad 1.</description>

      <description>My Thursday commute was dry, comfortable, and uneventful. I got up at 5 AM and was on the road by 5:30 AM. I think I will stick with this schedule. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sleep an hour later but it is not worth the increased traffic.</description>

      <description>Tuesday commute started out wet with mist and a couple of showers. The ride home was dry, unlike my shoes, and partly cloudy. One thing is for sure the traffic is far better at 5:30 AM than at 6:30 AM. The traffic is lighter and a little less frantic. Absolutely worth getting up at 5 AM for.

      <description>Had a rare tailwind this morning and it helped me achieve my personal best moving time of 46:59. I also had a little help from a slow moving 18 wheeler.

      <title>Contemplating the Commute</title>

      <description>Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.
Pros  4 hours of exercise a week Green Commute Enjoyable Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)  Cons  Dangerous Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)  The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike.</description>

      <description>[Broke my cheap clear sunglasses] (https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nfURpwsIbLAyPhASAA_PphbFkkcZAiCYWSvPTwsd8UpJtDCxqWtQCA_Hzg67TkO6NqSqa23hNofjbzt6CsFJOlnEAn_Phz01SqnyPdEm3b4fE-CjSH7iQTNAj1vsfJTmu_5mTIxTZnM=w2400) before I got out the door. On the ride to work I got honked at once and yelled at once. A passenger in a truck yelled &amp;ldquo;Get on the sidewalk!&amp;quot;. Yeah, that ain&amp;rsquo;t happening. 16 miles on a sidewalk would not be fun.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got new pavement on Main St in Moncks Corner SC. So nice. The road was in really bad shape. Love cycling on new tarmac.</description>
