      <description>Fell on my right hip again while turning onto the wet slimy Herbert H Jessen Public Boat Landing boardwalk. So mad at myself. I know how slippery boardwalks can be. After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s ride I felt pretty good and was on the mend. Then I go pull this stunt. 2020 just keeps on giving.
Ride on. â˜®

      <description>Took a spill at mile 57. While riding through the Riverfront Park I went from concrete to gravel and tried to get back on the concrete and fell over. The lip of the concrete was higher than I thought and acted like a rail. Fell over onto the concrete on my right side. Injured my hip, elbow and ribs. I could still ride pain free but walking was a different story.</description>
