      <description>Looking forward to a paved road from Cane Bay to Black Tom Rd. As of this post it is still a construction zone. Probably the toughest part of this route.
On the PM commute I had a water truck tailing me into a round-a-bout and I took the first out instead of the second. Before I realized what I had done I was half way to a dead end. Ended up in the woods again.</description>
