      <description>Old Yeller is still in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride to the Mt Pleasant Pier. Comfortable temperatures, nice sky, and a tailwind home. Pretty much a perfect summer evening. I was concerned about my lights dying but they hung on to the very end around 11 PM.

      <description>Old Yeller is in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride. The Giant Defy 3 rode pretty well. Not as comfy as the Giant Anyroad 1 but I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to have a decent backup.
The temperatures were pleasant. I could see lightning off in the distance for most of the ride but I avoided the rain. 20 minutes after getting home it was pouring.</description>
