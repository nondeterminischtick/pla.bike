      <description>After 130 miles yesterday I did not want to get back on the bike today but with my mileage goal within reach I saddled up. Glad I did. Goal accomplished. Currently have 10,004 logged miles for 2020. There are still 25 days left in the year. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll shoot for 11,000 or maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll chill.

      <description>Completed my one hundredth century ride. Feels good to accomplish another goal. My first century ride logged on Strava was May 26, 2018. I actually think I rode a few more century rides before this one but I&amp;rsquo;ll call this the first one. 903 days later I completed by 100th. Here they are on VeloViewer.
The remaining two goals for 2020 are 10,000 miles and covid-free. 9,299 miles so far. If I accomplish the last goal I should get the mileage goal.</description>

      <description>On the road by 3:40 AM. Heading east on Hwy 402 and Steed Creek roads I could see lightning from an offshore thunderstorm. The stars were bright overhead along with a waning crescent moon. So happy I screamed &amp;ldquo;The universe is mine!&amp;quot;.
After sunrise the clouds moved in and the temperature never rose above 75â„‰. In hindsight I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to wake up so early.
2020 is more than half over but I finally decided on 4 goals.</description>

      <description>Riding 200 miles is something that intrigued me and started to haunt me after my 160 mile Georgetown ride. What&amp;rsquo;s 40 more miles, right? A lot. I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any younger so I knocked this goal out while I still can.
Scheduling wasn&amp;rsquo;t wise on my part as it was dangerously hot. Bike computer read 104â„‰ a couple of times.
The first century went pretty well and was enjoyable. The second century, not so much.</description>

      <title>Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve Again</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I&amp;rsquo;ve cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.</description>
