        Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve Again

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I&rsquo;m really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I&rsquo;ve cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.

      Goose bumps were had while riding on the beach. First time beauty has had that affect on me.
This. was. an. absolutely. perfect. ride.
Riding over the James Island connector bridge there was a Waning Gibbous moon opposite the rising sun.
Temperatures were warm but not hot, blue sky, light winds, no altercations with automobiles, and I felt great, unlike last Saturday. I don&rsquo;t think it can get any better than this but I&rsquo;ll keep trying.

Traffic on Hwy 17 from Georgetown to Myrtle Beach was heavy with plenty of water ponding.

      Temperatures min/avg/max 41.0°F / 56.7°F / 69.8°F. Clear blue skies and light winds. First time cycling to Kiawah Island. Maybank Rd is fairly safe, Bohicket Rd not so much. Once you get to Kiawah there are paved bike paths. Their novelty wore thin and I took the road on the way out of Kiawah. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of golf courses and huge houses which is what Kiawah is all about but the ride was nice.

      48.2 °F at the start with a stiff headwind. I thought more than once about turning around in Moncks Corner. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. The middle section of the ride was good. Warmed up into the 60&rsquo;s with mostly a tail wind. Rode some gravel, rock, and mud on Tiger Corner Rd in the Francis Marion Forest. The headwinds returned once I got through Charleston. The temperature dropped a little as well.

I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.
At the end of my ride I rode by the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market for some Cookie Chick cookies.

It is the worst road surface I&rsquo;ve ever ridden. I don&rsquo;t think I will ride that highway again until they pave it which will probably be a very long time from now.
My favorite segments were the West Ashley Greenway, Charleston Battery, and Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.

Received an email today from Strava and Relive today. Relive can no longer use the Strava API. They reportedly violated several terms of the API. Relive made some software changes recently and made it much easier to create a video with their service. In addition to the tracking data Relive started transferring the title and photos from Strave.

      Part of Hwy 17-A approximately between Cypress Garden Rd and Black Tom Rd is getting resurfaced. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything wrong with the tarmac at least not in the area they are working on. Closer to Summerville the top of the asphalt is coming up big time. Will be interesting to see if this project goes that far. I&rsquo;m not complaining. Any new tarmac is welcomed.

      Another weather lucky day. I woke at 3 AM looked at the radar and said I can get to work before that rolls in.
The afternoon rain looked to almost be stationary to the south.
Another rain free commute. And for a bonus I had a rare tailwind on the ride home. Made pretty good time.

While on Hwy 17-A nearing Summerville I had someone sitting on their horn. I assume their anger was directed towards me. It was kinda of comical when I passed the car while it was waiting on traffic. They blew their horn the second time behind me. I really don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is.

      Morning routine is wake-up 4:30 AM, check radar, shower, dress, and cycle to work. This morning I pretended I didn&rsquo;t see the radar. There was a line of rain headed my way. I chose to ride anyway. Just a little bit of rain on sections of the ride. No biggie. I kept thinking about my Good Friday ride to Myrtle Beach in the rain. Nothing will compare to that downpour.

      The commute was good but afterwards was better. I picked up Old Yeller from Mike&rsquo;s Bikes. I got a new Shimano Tiagra derailleur and a cable, for free. It was free because the derailleur hanger snapped Saturday and destroyed the derailleur. Mike&rsquo;s Bikes has 30 day warranty on repair work. 👍 This is on top of the new cassette and chain from maintenance the week before. I paid for that work.

My Anker 10,000mAh battery only lasted about 5 months. I&rsquo;ve been attempting to charge it for 3 days without luck. The way I mount it on my bike it catches sweat so the connectors are corroded. Probably will buy another and flip it upside down this time.

This is the second commute on my Priority 600 with Pinion gearbox. While I&rsquo;m riding the 600 I keep bemoaning the resistance I feel compared to Old Yeller.

      Intrigued at the prospect of fewer drivetrain issues I bought a Priority 600 with a Pinion gearbox. Assembled last night and rode to work today. Initial reaction is it is a smooth ride but slow. The rolling resistance with the big 650b tires is noticeable as well as the resistance of the belt drive. At this point I don&rsquo;t see it replacing Old Yeller. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to get rid of the Defy 3 though.

      The low temperature on the PM commute (41℉) was cooler than the AM commute (44℉). The wind was kicking all day. Headwind on the AM ride and a tailwind on the way home. Difference of 14 minutes. Always happy with a sub 50 minute commute. 1:02:53 vs 49:04 moving time.
Became an East Coast Greenway Alliance member today. I would love to safely cycle from Charleston to Beaufort one day. 🤞

      Southeastern Wildlife Exposition (SEWE) started today. I think I&rsquo;ll stay clear of downtown Charleston tomorrow.
Mild winter continues. Another good commute.
Another restaurant chain in Summerville, Culver&rsquo;s. Never eaten at one. Glanced at the menu. Meh. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be frequenting Culver&rsquo;s.

      Happy to be riding Old Yeller again. Much more comfortable than the Defy 3. Speaking of which I picked up the Defy 3 from my LBS yesterday. They installed a new drive train and new tires. It now has 28&rsquo;s instead of 25&rsquo;s so it should be a little more comfortable.
Good commute today. Foggy this morning. Warm and windy on the way home. Ride on.

My LBS called about Old Yeller. The rear brake caliper is weak. They are going to replace it but not with a stock Giant caliper. Parts are ordered. The tech said they might be in tomorrow. I&rsquo;m betting it will be Monday. These extended maintenance events are frustrating.

I almost ran over a rabbit. One hopped out in front of me on Hwy 17-A. I missed it by inches. I didn&rsquo;t hear a thud so I assume and hope it got across the highway safely.

      The weather forecast called for rain around 5PM which would have been perfect if I left by 4PM. By lunch time I knew the rain was going to be here sooner than that. I left work a couple hours early to beat the rain. Drizzled most of the way home but no downpour. Stiff headwind accompanied the drizzle. Not one of my best commutes.
Thursday&rsquo;s forecast calls for a low of 28℉.

On the way home I was passed, at a high rate of speed, by a couple of dozen police vehicles with sirens blaring. They were mostly Berkeley County Sheriff vehicles. The others were unmarked. I don&rsquo;t know what was going down but I assume it was pretty serious.

Even with an awesome tailwind I can&rsquo;t snag a KOM. There are Strava 3 segments on the way to work. I am 2nd, 3rd, and 4th on the all time rankings. I thought today I might get my first KOM but I was still 34 seconds slower than the leader on the smaller of the 3 segments. Oh well, the ride to work was a lot of fun.

      Nothing special about today&rsquo;s commute. I was feeling cool air blowing into my shoe this morning. I guess it about time for some new ones. I have some Five Ten MTB bike shoes that have a nice hard sole but they are heavy. I may give them another try.

      Thursday tropical storm Michael was passing to the west of us. I contemplated riding to perhaps get a tail wind assisted KOM but I came to my senses. I drove my EV to work yesterday and cycled today.
55.4 °F was the low temperature during my AM commute. I don&rsquo;t like what is coming. I don&rsquo;t like it at all. I rather sweat than freeze any day. It won&rsquo;t be long before the Gore jacket and gloves are needed.

Upgraded my Garmin 520 to version 12.80. It wiped out my settings. Most importantly my sensors. I had to set the sensors up again. Software upgrades should not wipe out user settings. First world problems.

      It was pouring down rain around 4 AM. I went back to sleep and when I awoke at 5 AM the rain had stopped. I checked RadarScope. There were storms to the south and to the north but nothing between Summerville and Moncks Corner so I stuck to my plan. The road was wet but not a drop of rain fell on me. RadarScope is awesome. Good ride to work. A couple of hours later my back tire went flat.

      Tuesday&rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I snapped a photo of The Corner Cafe Bakery in Moncks Corner SC. It recently closed. A Starbucks recently opened and I assume that might have played into The Corner&rsquo;s decision to close. I had a rare tailwind on the way home which enabled me to break my 50 minute barrier again. Nice!

      Wheee - just having fun! Gorgeous weather continues. I didn&rsquo;t like the way my rear hub was sounding so I dropped off my Giant Anyroad 1 bike at Mike&rsquo;s Bikes in Mt Pleasant. Asked them to check all the bearings. Hopeful it will be a one day turn around so I can have it for the weekend. If not I&rsquo;ll be riding my Giant Defy 3 and wishing I was on my Anyroad 1.

One thing is for sure the traffic is far better at 5:30 AM than at 6:30 AM. The traffic is lighter and a little less frantic. Absolutely worth getting up at 5 AM for.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.
Pros  4 hours of exercise a week Green Commute Enjoyable Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)  Cons  Dangerous Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)  The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike.

      Broke my cheap clear sunglasses before I got out the door. On the ride to work I got honked at once and yelled at once. A passenger in a truck yelled &ldquo;Get on the sidewalk!&rdquo;. Yeah, that ain&rsquo;t happening. 16 miles on a sidewalk would not be fun.
We&rsquo;ve got new pavement on Main St in Moncks Corner SC. So nice. The road was in really bad shape. Love cycling on new tarmac.

      I&rsquo;m really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I&rsquo;ve cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.

      Old Yeller fell over after Tuesday&rsquo;s commute. Taking a photo and the wind knocked it over bending the derailleur hanger. Took a 3 hour lunch to Mike&rsquo;s Bikes on Folly Rd. They had about 50 hangers in stock but none fit mine. The technician used a derailleur hanger alignment gauge to whip it back in to shape. He also replace a jockey wheel. I finished up the day at work and went for an evening ride.

      While repairing my two punctures yesterday I realized it was time for new tires. The Specialized Armadillo tires had a few cuts, holes and dry rot. I replaced them with Continental GatorSkin DuraSkin tires. There is nothing wrong with the Specialized Armadillo brand. It was just more convenient and quicker to add the Gatorskins to my Amazon cart instead of going to Specialized&rsquo;s website.
I drove the Bolt EV back to the location of my first puncture yesterday to do some investigating.

      Shifting was less than stellar during yesterday&rsquo;s ride. Checked the chain and it is at .75% wear. Time for a replacement.

I see some wear on the cassette as well. I may get that replaced. I will drop off the Giant Anyroad 1 at Mike&rsquo;s Bikes today.

The Park Cyclone Chain Scrubber works well but the rivets that hold the clips fall out. I&rsquo;ve lost one rivet. The other one falls out occasionally.

I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.
