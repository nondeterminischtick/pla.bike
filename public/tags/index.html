      I&rsquo;m really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I&rsquo;ve cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.

      Completed my one hundredth century ride. Feels good to accomplish another goal. My first century ride logged on Strava was May 26, 2018. I actually think I rode a few more century rides before this one but I&rsquo;ll call this the first one. 903 days later I completed by 100th. Here they are on VeloViewer.
The remaining two goals for 2020 are 10,000 miles and covid-free. 9,299 miles so far. If I accomplish the last goal I should get the mileage goal.

      Bizarre when your route is a loop and you have a headwind the entire ride. Expected the sun to come out sooner. So glad to see it when it finally did.
The highlight of the ride was getting a leadout by a bald eagle on Cane Gully Rd. Such a magnificent bird. Saw a big owl early in the ride. Also impressive. The most entertaining animal goes to the goat. Saw a couple of pastures with goats.

The wildflowers growing on the side of the road were nice. Lots of yellow, blue, and dark red flowers.

      Burned all my matches about 30 miles in and paid for it dearly. Tried a change to my normal route to Edisto Beach. Took Old Jacksonboro Rd off of Hwy 165. This segment runs parallel with Hwy 17 above it. Everything was fine until Old Jacksonboro Rd crossed New Rd. At that point it turned from pavement to a deep soft sand road.

Scheduling wasn&rsquo;t wise on my part as it was dangerously hot. Bike computer read 104℉ a couple of times.
The first century went pretty well and was enjoyable. The second century, not so much.

      The morning air was cool and dry for a day in June. Ride started with 3 turkeys and 2 deer showing their faces near Ridgeville. From Ridgeville I traveled through Harleville, Santee, Eutawville, Eutaw Springs, Cross and back home.
Good bit of wind. Sometimes favorable but mostly not.
Crossed paths and momentarily rode with a couple of cyclist from Harleyville. They were must faster than me. I was expecting to find out who they were via Strava Flyby but they must not be on Strava or if they are they don&rsquo;t post publicly.

Heading out of Georgetown I took South Island Rd all the way until it ends at the Yawkey Wildlife Center ferry. It added a couple of miles but it was well worth it.

Recurring theme for Saturday rides is moving at least one turtle off the road. Today&rsquo;s turtle was a little larger than the two last week. As I was telling it to stay off the road it tried to pee on me. Thankfully the stream went between my legs.
I traveled some new-to-me roads: Horseford Rd, Sandridge Rd, Old Beech Hill Rd, and Zion Rd just to name a few.

Picked up my assorted dozen, ate one, and put the rest in the Topeak backloader.

      Not much to see in Orangeburg but it was a ride I wanted to complete at least once. There is an 8 mile stretch on Hwy 78 that is pretty stressful traffic wise. I dreaded that segment on the way up and back. Things chill out once you get on Hwy 178. The majority of the ride is on Hwy 178.
After taking a spin around Orangeburg I took a wrong turn and asked Google navigation to get me home.

      First time visiting I&rsquo;on Swamp. Scenic ride on a well maintained gravel forestry road. 👍
Crossing the Cooper River I chose the road instead of the multi-use path. There were too many pedestrians and cyclist for the COVID-19 era. I assume it is perfectly legal but probably frowned upon by motorist and police. I survived.
This is the first century ride since March 21, 2020 in which I was exhausted at about mile 50.

Rode Old Yeller today instead of the single speed. It feels like the rolling resistance is greater on Old Yeller than the Wabi Classic single speed. I think the last couple of century rides on the single speed were easier than today&rsquo;s. The extra gears are nice for bridges and headwinds but if I enjoy riding the single speed more perhaps I just need to toughen up.

      Rode up to Lake Marion and around Lake Moultrie. The single speed is perfect when it is flat and the headwinds are gentle. It is tough when climbing hills and bridges. Headwinds are no fun either. I definitively work harder on the Wabi Classic than I do on the Giant Anyroad 1. The simplicity of the single speed is very appealing. It is also the funnest bike I&rsquo;ve ridden.

      The Wabi Classic continues to surprise me. The 46/18 gearing is about perfect.

Didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever demote Old Yeller but watch out. The simplicity of the single speed is just so attractive. Fun times.
There was a group of about 6 teenage motorcycle riders on the West Ashley Greenway.

Many of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s Robinson relatives still reside in Georgetown. Very cool in my book.
The shortest route is 130 miles but returning on the same route is boring so I chose the longer route home.

A look-out tower near the South Santee River provides breathtaking views.
As far as the ride goes it was great. I started from Moncks Corner instead of Summerville.

While emptying the trash from my jersey pocket at the farmer&rsquo;s market my leg brushed against a poisonous plant. I guess it was poison oak or ivy.

      Oh my. What a hidden treasure. Wee Tee WMA is awesome. You can access it right off of Hwy 17-A north of Santee River. Surprised to see hills surrounding several beautiful lakes. Absolutely beautiful.
My plan was to cut across to St Stephen SC but I ended up back on Hwy 17-A. Not a fan of returning home via the same route so I headed to Andrews SC and caught Hwy 521.

      Wow, what a beautiful ride. I was having a hard time deciding where to ride. Decided to explore Rice Hope Plantation and Bonneau Ferry Wildlife Management Area. Good decision. Rode miles of gravel roads. The scenery was off the chart. Truly gorgeous area. To cap the ride off I rode the Lake Moultrie west dike.

      I&rsquo;ve been contemplating a ride to Hunting Island, Beaufort, or Savannah GA. I chose today&rsquo;s ride to the Donnelley Wildlife Management Area for more time on Hwy 17. The road surface is not good and traffic is pretty heavy until you get past Jacksonboro SC. A ride to Beaufort is going to be pretty monotonous but it is doable. We&rsquo;ll see.
Donnelly WMA is pretty cool. I looped around it on a pretty good gravel road.

      Drizzle right from the start of the ride. Actually thought I would have had more rain than I did. The steadiest downpour was around Remount and Rivers in North Charleston. Kinda refreshing.
The highlight of the ride was a huge owl flyby in the Dunes West subdivision. Magnificent animal.
Ride was pleasant. Finished up the ride with a stop at the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market to buy the last two Cookie Chick oatmeal cookies.

      Double puncture. The first at mile 81 the second at mile 82. Both were staples in the rear tire. On the first puncture I replaced the tube. On the second I used a patch. My mini pump was pretty much useless. I was near a pay pump on the first one and got it rideable. On the second I couldn&rsquo;t get enough air in it to ride so I started walking.

 An abundance of sunshine A lack of headwinds An early start Cool temperatures Nutrition (although I didn&rsquo;t do anything different)  I went to bed last night excited that today was going to be awesome. I was not disappointed.

The route to Edisto Beach is fairly scenic if you can ignore the roadside litter. There are cypress swamps, marshes, beautiful oak trees, a variety of birds and of course there is the ocean.
Good day on the saddle.

      All century rides are tough but the head winds on the way to Kingstree made this one especially challenging. Considered cutting my ride short more than once. Glad I toughed it out. Was concerned about getting home before the temperatures started dropping. Towards the end of a century it is hard to keep your body temperature up since you don&rsquo;t have the energy but it worked out on this ride. Arrived home before 5 PM.

      It rained before I got on the road and it looked like it was going to be a dreary wet day. Thankfully I was deceived. There was a 3 hour period of weather perfection. The sun was shining and temperatures topped out at 71°F. It was so nice. I removed my sleeves from my jacket and took off my gloves at the beach. When I hit North Charleston the clouds returned along with some wind so I put the sleeves and gloves back on.

Morning ride was good.
Misjudged the speed of tropical storm Eta by about an hour. Still raining when I left work a little after 5 PM. When the wind was behind me I felt pretty good. Gusty crosswinds made me wonder if I would make it home or not.

The ride home was a soaker once I got into Del Webb. At least it was warm.

      Remnants of hurricane Zeta provided a kind tailwind to work and soggy headwind on the way home.
Meanwhile I am teed off at my body. My right knee and hip ain&rsquo;t right. From what I gather through YouTube is I may have an IT band issue probably brought on by my two falls on 4 October and 11 October.
Got goals to complete. No time to be taking time off the bike to heal.

      Tried an alternate route on the way home. One that would minimize the time on Hwy 17-A. I took Bonnoitt St, Whitesville Rd, and Old Whitesville Rd. All 3 roads have pretty rough tarmac and are 2 lane. I will stick with Hwy 17-A. At least it is 4 lanes and has good tarmac.
The segment I really want to replace is Black Tom Rd. A 2 lane 55 mph race track filled with impatient drivers.

      After yesterday&rsquo;s puncturefest I decided to replace the tires and tubes on the single speed. The Wabi Classic is now sporting Continental Gatorskins 700x28c tires. Also, started carrying the Zefal HPX-3 frame pump ditching the mini pump. Storing the Zefal between the bag and top tube.
The new tires perform well. The former tires were 32c. The 28c tires might be a littler squirrelier.
Morning ride was rather foggy and the evening ride was pretty moist as well.

      My first did not finish (DNF) commute. A tack was the culprit. Before installing the new tube I felt around the tire twice and did not find anything. Needless to say the new tube punctured after about a mile. Searched for some water to find the hole in the tube. Stepped in ankle deep mud getting to the water. Found the hole in the tube and then was able to find the tack in the tire, patched the new tube.

Last night I received a frame commemorating my double century ride from my brother. His better half created the drawing in the middle. Super nice. 💙

      Woke up at 4 AM and couldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep so I hopped on my bike. On the Lake Moultrie dike I watched the sunrise. Sweet.
Instead of storing clothes at work I carried them in my back loader. The back loader isn&rsquo;t quite big enough for my clothes, towels and my repair kit. The repair kit fell out the back of the bag on the way to work. Luckily I heard it hit the road and repacked it.

      Sorry heat haters. I love riding in the 80&rsquo;s℉. 85℉ for me is a sweet spot. Just keep pedaling and it feels great.
This is a holiday week so I am commuting Monday and Wednesday instead of Tuesday and Thursday. Going to attempt a couple of century rides this Independence Day weekend. One Friday and one Sunday. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.
Will ride rural again to lessen my chances of catching Covid-19.

      This is not the South Carolina I signed up for. The weather has been gloomy, windy, and chilly for days. This morning&rsquo;s ride was a wet one. Misting in Summerville and 57℉ according to the bicycle computer. I wore a jacket to and from work. This is June, right?
On the plus side the wind in my face on my way to work didn&rsquo;t shift and was at my back on the way home.

      Which Wich, my favorite sandwich shop, reopened today after a couple of months. My plan was to leave work 1 hour early at 4, ride my bike home, shower and be there by 5:30 PM. I rode probably harder than any other commute against a headwind. Got there by 5:25 PM to find the doors locked with a sign &ldquo;We are closing at 5:30 due to the curfew&rdquo;. Maybe tomorrow.

      Trying out a later start. I was getting up around 4:30 AM, getting to work before 6:00 AM, cooling down, eating breakfast and changing clothes. All that was done before others arrived at the office. There are some advantages to starting early like less automobile traffic and privacy when you are the first to arrive at the office. The down side is getting up so dang early and leaving work at 4 PM when there is always someone needing something at the end of the day from me.

      On my. This is a fun bike to ride. The single speed Wabi Classic arrived yesterday. Assembled and test ridden last night. Rode it work work today. I was a little apprehensive that it might be too tough for this old man to ride. Turns out the 46/18 gearing is just about perfect for the flat lowcountry. Speedy yet not spinny. Tough up a hill but not too tough. It might be too tough in a strong headwind.

Installed, poorly, a saddle I had laying around last night (Specialized Elaston). Came loose riding over a rock construction entrance about 8 miles from work. Rode it in like that. Was out of the saddle a good bit. Got it sorted for my lunch ride and commute home.

Gave some thought of buying the Giant Contend AR 1 2020 as the geometry and components are fairly close to my Giant Anyroad 1 but that is not the proper thing to do. Keep repairing Old Yeller until the frame snaps in two.

      Chain is worn. Skips when I get out of the saddle. Gonna replace it Friday night. Probably will ride another century Saturday for the 15th consecutive weekend.
Commute was good. New PM route is working out good. If they can get that exit off of Black Tom Rd paved it would be ace.

      Looking forward to a paved road from Cane Bay to Black Tom Rd. As of this post it is still a construction zone. Probably the toughest part of this route.
On the PM commute I had a water truck tailing me into a round-a-bout and I took the first out instead of the second. Before I realized what I had done I was half way to a dead end. Ended up in the woods again.

      Took the multi-use path in Cane Bay until it ended. Tried to get back on track by cutting through the woods. Ended up on Hwy 176 in front of the under construction Nexton Parkway. Hopped on the gravel and headed home. Made the PM commute almost 22 miles. Cool.

      The new PM route through Cane Bay is growing on me. Really the only sketchy part is Black Tom Rd. Getting off of Black Tom Rd and into Cane Bay is a little precarious too. The entrance is lined with golf ball size rocks, then sand, and finally a construction machinery crossing. Once I hit the pavement it is good. The automobile traffic picks up the closer I get to Hwy 176.

      Took the usual route in the AM and a different route in the PM. Entered the back of Cane Bay via Black Tom Rd. The difference is a toss up. Hwy 17-A, the usual route, is busy but at least it is 4 lanes. Black Tom Rd is only two lanes with trucks and cars that won&rsquo;t slow down for a cyclist. The Cane Bay route is about 5 miles longer which isn&rsquo;t a big deal but the chance of getting hit by a motor vehicle is about the same on both routes.

      Uneventful commute this week. I gnashed my shin with my pedal at a traffic light. Bled like a fountain. Other than that it was a quiet week. Looking forward to the weekend. Probably knock out a century Saturday.
Sunday I have an appointment to see a cottage at Nexton. The new line of homes are supposed to be smaller than the mansions they normally build. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get out of this apartment one day.

      Nice commute. The ride home was cooler for an August afternoon. We had a few rain showers around noon which helped keep temperature below normal.

      Old Yeller fresh from the LBS is shifting like a Ford Pinto low on transmission fluid. What a way to start the day. The rear derailleur had a mind of its own.

Received an email today from Strava and Relive today. Relive can no longer use the Strava API. They reportedly violated several terms of the API. Relive made some software changes recently and made it much easier to create a video with their service. In addition to the tracking data Relive started transferring the title and photos from Strave.

      Before getting on the road home it rained a little bit. Temperatures were lower than usual. Made for a pleasant ride home.
Replaced my ridiculously over priced rear view mirror. The old one was dark in spots and generally hazy. Enjoyed a better view during today&rsquo;s commute.

After work, against my better judgment, I ate at Taco Boy on opening day. Wasn&rsquo;t too crazy. Had a couple of vegan tacos and a Dos Equis. I didn&rsquo;t see any local brews on tap. I&rsquo;ll go back after the newness wears off.

      Part of Hwy 17-A approximately between Cypress Garden Rd and Black Tom Rd is getting resurfaced. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything wrong with the tarmac at least not in the area they are working on. Closer to Summerville the top of the asphalt is coming up big time. Will be interesting to see if this project goes that far. I&rsquo;m not complaining. Any new tarmac is welcomed.

Another rain free commute. And for a bonus I had a rare tailwind on the ride home. Made pretty good time.

      Four straight days of 100℉. Thankfully there was some cloud cover on my way home. The Garmin recorded a high of 99℉.
While on Hwy 17-A nearing Summerville I had someone sitting on their horn. I assume their anger was directed towards me. It was kinda of comical when I passed the car while it was waiting on traffic. They blew their horn the second time behind me. I really don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is.

      Morning routine is wake-up 4:30 AM, check radar, shower, dress, and cycle to work. This morning I pretended I didn&rsquo;t see the radar. There was a line of rain headed my way. I chose to ride anyway. Just a little bit of rain on sections of the ride. No biggie. I kept thinking about my Good Friday ride to Myrtle Beach in the rain. Nothing will compare to that downpour.

Had a nice chat with a neighborhood cyclist who just moved here from New Jersey. He works at Volvo and is a couple of years older than me. He was wondering where all the cyclists were. I told him about a couple of group rides.

      The commute was good but afterwards was better. I picked up Old Yeller from Mike&rsquo;s Bikes. I got a new Shimano Tiagra derailleur and a cable, for free. It was free because the derailleur hanger snapped Saturday and destroyed the derailleur. Mike&rsquo;s Bikes has 30 day warranty on repair work. 👍 This is on top of the new cassette and chain from maintenance the week before. I paid for that work.

 Get up 2 hours early to avoid morning traffic Take 2 showers instead of 1 Bicycle 32 miles (this is the good part) Risk life cycling with automobiles Battle the elements: wind, rain, heat, and cold  This morning was in the 30&rsquo;s℉.

      Misty morning and clear afternoon. Pretty good commute if I forget about bubba babbling about getting off the road or end up in pieces. Jeez. 98% of automobile drivers behave properly. About once a day some dude, usually in a truck, has to tell me to get off the road. This time the passenger opened his door on Hwy 17-A and yelled. Stay classy bubba. Oh well. Ride on. ☮

      Cool, strong, headwind this morning had me contemplating why I ride my bike to work when I have a perfectly good electric vehicle. The tail/crosswind on the way home made me forget all about the struggle I had 11 hours earlier.
Had blast on the ride home. Spliced the slightly interesting video clips together with Kdenlive. Good commute. Ride on. ☮

      I have named my Priority 600 The Beast. It is big, heavy, and hard to move. Don&rsquo;t know if it was tired legs, headwind, The Beast or all of those things that made the ride home tough.

      Beautiful weather today made for an enjoyable commute. Except for bubba yelling at me to get off the f&rsquo;ing road at Black Tom Rd &amp; Hwy 17-A intersection it was a chill ride home.
My Anker 10,000mAh battery only lasted about 5 months. I&rsquo;ve been attempting to charge it for 3 days without luck. The way I mount it on my bike it catches sweat so the connectors are corroded. Probably will buy another and flip it upside down this time.

      Chilly start. Temperatures were in the twenties this morning. Super nice this afternoon. Clear blues skies and mild temperatures.
This is the second commute on my Priority 600 with Pinion gearbox. While I&rsquo;m riding the 600 I keep bemoaning the resistance I feel compared to Old Yeller. The commute takes about 5 minutes longer on the 600. I need to get over the added weight and resistance. Riding to lunch and dinner on the 600 is perfect.

      Intrigued at the prospect of fewer drivetrain issues I bought a Priority 600 with a Pinion gearbox. Assembled last night and rode to work today. Initial reaction is it is a smooth ride but slow. The rolling resistance with the big 650b tires is noticeable as well as the resistance of the belt drive. At this point I don&rsquo;t see it replacing Old Yeller. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to get rid of the Defy 3 though.

      The low temperature on the PM commute (41℉) was cooler than the AM commute (44℉). The wind was kicking all day. Headwind on the AM ride and a tailwind on the way home. Difference of 14 minutes. Always happy with a sub 50 minute commute. 1:02:53 vs 49:04 moving time.

      Happy to be riding Old Yeller again. Much more comfortable than the Defy 3. Speaking of which I picked up the Defy 3 from my LBS yesterday. They installed a new drive train and new tires. It now has 28&rsquo;s instead of 25&rsquo;s so it should be a little more comfortable.

My LBS called about Old Yeller. The rear brake caliper is weak. They are going to replace it but not with a stock Giant caliper. Parts are ordered. The tech said they might be in tomorrow. I&rsquo;m betting it will be Monday. These extended maintenance events are frustrating.

I almost ran over a rabbit. One hopped out in front of me on Hwy 17-A. I missed it by inches. I didn&rsquo;t hear a thud so I assume and hope it got across the highway safely.

      The weather forecast called for rain around 5PM which would have been perfect if I left by 4PM. By lunch time I knew the rain was going to be here sooner than that. I left work a couple hours early to beat the rain. Drizzled most of the way home but no downpour. Stiff headwind accompanied the drizzle. Not one of my best commutes.
Thursday&rsquo;s forecast calls for a low of 28℉.

On the way home I was passed, at a high rate of speed, by a couple of dozen police vehicles with sirens blaring. They were mostly Berkeley County Sheriff vehicles. The others were unmarked. I don&rsquo;t know what was going down but I assume it was pretty serious.
Looking forward to the 3 day weekend.

      Garmin computer reported a low of 32°F on the commute this morning. I kinda doubt that. I&rsquo;m thinking it was mid to upper 30&rsquo;s. Average temperature on the way home was 41°F. Thursday morning is forecasted to be in the upper 20&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll see if I brave that commute.

      Moncks Corner put out there Christmas decorations just in time for Thanksgiving.
Commute was good. Traffic was a smidgen lighter due to the upcoming holiday. I have a 4 day weekend. Too bad the best weather day is Thanksgiving day. I&rsquo;ll squeeze in some miles between the rain showers.
New lighter colored carpet was installed in my place of employment. I purchased a mat for my office where I park my bike in the bikehand.

      This must be what riding a penny-farthing feels like. My new bike fit has me higher and more upright. Felt like my quadriceps were working harder today. So far, so good.
Windy day. Head wind on the way to work and tail wind on the way home. 16.4 MPH vs 21.3 MPH. Enjoyed the ride home 100 times more than the ride to work. There was rain to our northwest and offshore but not a drop in Moncks Corner or Summerville.

      Thursday tropical storm Michael was passing to the west of us. I contemplated riding to perhaps get a tail wind assisted KOM but I came to my senses. I drove my EV to work yesterday and cycled today.
55.4 °F was the low temperature during my AM commute. I don&rsquo;t like what is coming. I don&rsquo;t like it at all. I rather sweat than freeze any day. It won&rsquo;t be long before the Gore jacket and gloves are needed.

Upgraded my Garmin 520 to version 12.80. It wiped out my settings. Most importantly my sensors. I had to set the sensors up again. Software upgrades should not wipe out user settings. First world problems.

#Morning Trek A breath of cool air, the smell of pavement entrance and entice the morning senses with freedom from the daily enslavement of cars and trucks and motorized fences.

      It was pouring down rain around 4 AM. I went back to sleep and when I awoke at 5 AM the rain had stopped. I checked RadarScope. There were storms to the south and to the north but nothing between Summerville and Moncks Corner so I stuck to my plan. The road was wet but not a drop of rain fell on me. RadarScope is awesome. Good ride to work. A couple of hours later my back tire went flat.

I brought my Nvidia Shield to work for a coworker to borrow. I packed it in my Topeak Backloader bicycle bag and it stayed dry. Yay! I was able to cycle to lunch without getting rained. Yay again! The ride home was a soaker but at least the winds were calm and the temperature was a comfortable 69.

      Tried a new route on the morning commute. I got off of Hwy 17-A at Gaillard Rd over to Old Hwy 52. Nice change of scenery. It was not quite a mile longer.
The afternoon commute got off to a slow start. Before I could work up a sweat I was stopped by not one but two trains. The first freight train was long and slow. Towards the end with just a dozen cars left to pass the crossing a second freight train coming from the opposite direction appeared.

      Picked up Old Yeller from Mike&rsquo;s Bikes yesterday. It has a new rear derailleur, chain, rear tire, and cassette. The ride to work was super smooth. Really glad to have the Giant Anyroad 1 back. It is so much nicer than my backup bike, Giant Defy 3. I can&rsquo;t recall an average MPH of 20 so I think this was a personal best. There is something motivational about a new drivetrain.

      Thursday&rsquo;s commute was uneventful. I rode to Chipotle for dinner and afterwards rode up Hwy 78.

I headed back up 17-A and took Holiday Dr to Nexton Parkway instead. Even though I had been on Nexton Parkway many times this was the first time with automobile traffic.

      Contemplating my twice-a-week bicycle commute. It is 16.2 miles between Moncks Corner and Summerville. Most of the ride is on Hwy 17-A which is a busy 4 lane highway. The section from my apartment in Summerville to Cypress Gardens Rd is the busiest section. Cypress Gardens Rd intersection to Moncks Corner is lower traffic and a pleasant ride.
Pros  4 hours of exercise a week Green Commute Enjoyable Accomplishing 2 things a once (commute and exercise)  Cons  Dangerous Abuse from drivers (yelling, honking, revving, close drive by)  The benefits are many but sometimes feel that I am being irresponsible to my family and to my employer by risking my life on my bike.

      Took a spill at mile 57. While riding through the Riverfront Park I went from concrete to gravel and tried to get back on the concrete and fell over. The lip of the concrete was higher than I thought and acted like a rail. Fell over onto the concrete on my right side. Injured my hip, elbow and ribs. I could still ride pain free but walking was a different story.

      After a couple of weeks of acquiring tools, parts, and knowledge I have Old Yeller back on the road. Replaced the slipping freehub with a new one last night. Rode Old Yeller to work today. Super nice. Good tailwind home. Average speed 20 MPH.
Took several days of research to find the correct freehub, SRAM MTH 506. It shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard.

      Old Yeller fell over after Tuesday&rsquo;s commute. Taking a photo and the wind knocked it over bending the derailleur hanger. Took a 3 hour lunch to Mike&rsquo;s Bikes on Folly Rd. They had about 50 hangers in stock but none fit mine. The technician used a derailleur hanger alignment gauge to whip it back in to shape. He also replace a jockey wheel. I finished up the day at work and went for an evening ride.

      While repairing my two punctures yesterday I realized it was time for new tires. The Specialized Armadillo tires had a few cuts, holes and dry rot. I replaced them with Continental GatorSkin DuraSkin tires. There is nothing wrong with the Specialized Armadillo brand. It was just more convenient and quicker to add the Gatorskins to my Amazon cart instead of going to Specialized&rsquo;s website.
I drove the Bolt EV back to the location of my first puncture yesterday to do some investigating.

      Matty Floyd of Affordabike in Charleston performed a bike fit on me. First bike fit I&rsquo;ve had. It was something I felt I should do at least once so I took the day off to get it done. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I took a day off.
Matty with the help of the GURU Dynamic Fit Unit made some changes to my fit. Raised my seat post, installed a new stem, adjusted by hoods, etc&hellip; I&rsquo;m sitting allot higher on the Giant Anyroad 1 bicycle now.

      Shifting was less than stellar during yesterday&rsquo;s ride. Checked the chain and it is at .75% wear. Time for a replacement.

I see some wear on the cassette as well. I may get that replaced. I will drop off the Giant Anyroad 1 at Mike&rsquo;s Bikes today.

The Park Cyclone Chain Scrubber works well but the rivets that hold the clips fall out. I&rsquo;ve lost one rivet. The other one falls out occasionally.

      Old Yeller is still in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride to the Mt Pleasant Pier. Comfortable temperatures, nice sky, and a tailwind home. Pretty much a perfect summer evening. I was concerned about my lights dying but they hung on to the very end around 11 PM.

      Old Yeller is in the shop getting a new drivetrain so I took the backup bike for a night ride. The Giant Defy 3 rode pretty well. Not as comfy as the Giant Anyroad 1 but I&rsquo;m fortunate to have a decent backup.
The temperatures were pleasant. I could see lightning off in the distance for most of the ride but I avoided the rain. 20 minutes after getting home it was pouring.

      Woke up around 3 AM and was on the road at 4:40 AM. From Summerville I rode through Moncks Corner, Bonneau, St Stephen, Pineville, Cross, Holly Hill, and Harleyville. It was a little chilly this morning until the sun came up. Not looking forward to summer ending.
I think I fueled too much too quickly. My stomach was a little sore.
At the end of my ride I rode by the Summerville Farmer&rsquo;s Market for some Cookie Chick cookies.

      I&rsquo;m really digging the ride to the Childsbury Towne Heritage Preserve. If I recall correctly I&rsquo;ve cycled to it 3 weekends straight. Hwy 402 and Dr Evans Rd have a nice surface and low weekend traffic. On the way I stopped by the new YMCA in Cane Bay. From the outside this looks like a super nice facility. My favorite amenity is the water bottle refill station out by the tennis courts.
