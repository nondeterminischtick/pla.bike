      <description>4 days left the in Festive 500. Currently at 422 km of 500 km. Going to add a few miles to my commute on Tuesday to complete the challenge.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t take many photos today. Main goals were keep my core temperature up and get home before dark. Mission accomplished.
Ride on. â˜®

      <description>Accepted the Rapha Festive 500 challenge, to ride 500 kilometers (310 miles) between Christmas Eve and New Yearâ€™s Eve.
Looking at the 10 day forecast, today was going to be the warmest day. Decided to ride as many miles as I could. Started the ride shortly after midnight and headed to Folly Beach, Edge of America. Unfortunately along with the warmer temperatures came rain and wind.
Stayed relatively dry the first half of the ride by checking the radar frequently and seeking shelter.</description>
